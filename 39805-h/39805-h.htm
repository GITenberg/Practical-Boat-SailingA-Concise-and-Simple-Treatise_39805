<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>This little work is not written to teach any thing
new to those who know how to sail boats well and
safely, but only for the purpose of enabling any person,
after a perusal of its pages, to feel confident of
handling a boat so as to be <i>perfectly safe</i>, and to have
some knowledge of the rules which should govern its
movements under all conditions that might naturally
arise. This sport is far less dangerous than is supposed;
and it may even be asserted that no kind of
amusement is safer during the summer months in
these latitudes,&mdash;many not as safe. Some one has
truly said "that the boat is always under the perfect
control, and subject to the will, of its master; whilst
in driving, for instance, one is dependent for life and
limb upon the forbearance, good-temper, and training
of a brute whose strength is greater than one's own,
and whose over-vaunted intelligence is often exceeded
by his obstinacy."</p>

<p>It is simply wonderful what stress of wind and sea
a small boat will sustain <i>with perfect safety</i> when
properly managed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4">[4]</a></span>It is hoped that the following pages will be sufficient
to post all tyros in the <i>technique</i> of the science,
and enable them to execute all the man&oelig;uvres that
are needful, and to know the names and uses of all
the important ropes, sails, &amp;c.; <i>so that they will not
have to ask anybody any questions</i>, and be able to
"paddle their own canoe."</p>

<p>If the author has succeeded in making himself
understood, so that the student will feel competent
to take charge of his own boat or yacht with confidence,
he will be amply repaid.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but what there may be a difference
of opinion amongst yachtsmen and boatmen as
to the best manner of executing many sea-evolutions.
The author has chosen those which have stood the
test of time, and are comparatively simple, and easy
of execution, fitted for small craft, and perfectly safe.</p>

<p>Several useful hints have been gathered by an
inspection of Bowditch's "Epitome" and Brady's
"Kedge-Anchor."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h4>THE MODEL, RIG, AND NAMES OF THE SAILS AND
ROPES IN COMMON USE.</h4>

<p>It would be beyond the province or scope of
this work to enumerate all the different models and
peculiarities of the numerous crafts and rigs that
are used to navigate the waters, both in civilized
and uncivilized countries; and we must content
ourselves by taking into consideration a few of the
most pronounced types that are now in vogue, and
explaining their principles as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>Local prejudices rule strong in all parts of the
world; and the rig, size, and model of a boat,
are almost always defined by the "custom" of
the waters in which it is to be sailed: still it is
perhaps well to give a few general rules for the
selection of a boat. For bays, sounds, harbors,
and inland tidal waters connected with the sea, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8">[8]</a></span>
boat or small yacht should be of a shoal model,
and what is termed the centre-board principle, and
usually the sloop or cat-boat rig.</p>

<p>For ponds, and small lakes of fresh water, the
boat should always be of good beam, light draught,
and small sail, on account of the frequency of puffs
of winds from unexpected quarters from the neighboring
hillsides. In fact, if there is any danger in
sailing, it is upon these land-locked ponds or lakes,
where more seamanship is often needed than on
the larger bays and sounds of the ocean itself.</p>

<p>For outside work, or in places where the tidal
currents are strong, or the wind may sweep across
the water for miles, "kicking up a sea," the deep
keel model, with schooner or cutter rig, will be the
better boat; this class being considered superior
in working to windward in a heavy sea to the
shoaler craft. But, even on this question, there are
disagreements; and you shall hear of those who
maintain that the shoal-water centre-board craft is
the better boat in a heavy sea-way; and some
lovers of a craft called a "sharpie" tell startling
tales of its endurance in heavy weather, although it
is the shoalest of all shoal boats. The advantage
of the centre-board boat over the keel boat for
harbor and sound sailing, or wherever the tide rises
and falls to any great extent, is obvious. With the
latter, one is liable to be brought up upon an
unknown sand-bank or ledge, and compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9">[9]</a></span>
remain, sometimes for hours, till floated off; whilst
with the centre-board, upon touching any danger
or shoal, the board is hauled up, and the boat that
a moment before drew, perhaps, six feet of water,
now draws but one foot, allowing one to "go
about," or steer to one side, and avoid the obstacle,
and get home in time for supper. In short, in the
opinion of the writer, it is only for outside use, and
for a larger class of vessels than this book will treat
of, that the keel boat is needed.</p>

<p>To avoid repetition, and to condense as much as
possible, so as to be useful to all for practicable
purposes, what is termed the <i>sloop-rig</i>&mdash;one quite
as frequently used as any other for small boats&mdash;is
presented in the accompanying diagram. This will
be described as briefly as possible consistent with
a thorough explanation of the sails, ropes, &amp;c., and
their different names and uses; it being, of course,
understood that the management of a sloop in a
seamanlike manner carries with it the knowledge of
managing a yacht of any rig, the principle applying
equally to all; and to describe the "staying," "wearing,"
and absolute management of each sail and rope
of each separate rig, would be unnecessary, and
extend this little work to a greater length than is
desirable. The best that can be done is to take
a type, and, having made that familiar, the whole
science of boat-sailing will have been acquired.</p>

<p>The sloop-rig consists of the following-named
spars:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10">[10]</a></span>The <i>mainmast</i> (c c), which is usually placed
at about two-thirds of the boat's length from the
stern. This spar serves to sustain the <i>mainsail</i>(1)
by a series of hoops which encircle it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i002.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="Mast structure" /></div>

<p>The <i>main topmast</i> (d d), which is fitted to the
head of the <i>mainmast</i>, and terminates at its upper
end in a small ball, called the <i>truck</i>, through the
sides of which are fitted little <i>sheaves</i> (i.e., wheels),
by means of which, and the use of a small-sized
rope, called <i>signal-halliards</i>, the flag, or private
signal of the boat, is hoisted to the <i>topmast's</i> head,
and displayed.</p>

<p>This spar also serves to sustain the <i>gaff-topsail</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11">[11]</a></span>
(3), which is hoisted and lowered along its length
by a series of hoops encircling the spar. This sail,
as a rule, is set and furled from the <i>top</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>bowsprit</i> (h), which projects from the bow
of the boat, and serves to support the <i>mainmast</i> by
means of a stay (g g) leading from its outer end
to the <i>mainmast</i> head, and another stay, called
the <i>bobstay</i> (f), to the prow of the boat. The <i>jib-stay</i>
(g g) serves to hoist and set the <i>jib</i> (2) upon,&mdash;the
most important sail, after the mainsail.</p>

<p>The <i>jib-boom</i> (i), which extends out beyond
the <i>bowsprit</i>, its heel being made fast to the latter,
and, by means of stays, supports the <i>mainmast</i> and
<i>main-topmast</i>; and upon the inner one of these is
hoisted and set the outer or <i>flying jib</i> (4), the
other (k) supporting the <i>main-topmast</i>, and called
the <i>main-topmast stay</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>main-gaff</i> (e e), which sustains and stretches
the <i>head</i> of the <i>mainsail</i>, which is securely lashed
to it by means of small seizings, or lashings.</p>

<p>The <i>main-boom</i> (b b), which receives and
stretches the <i>foot</i> of the mainsail, to which it is
securely lashed.</p>

<p>The above constitute the main spars and sails of
a boat of the sloop rig.</p>

<p>To enable one to understand all that follows, it
will be necessary to acquire a little more information
concerning these spars and sails, and the names
and uses of the principal ropes, sheets,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12">[12]</a></span>As the reader faces the cut, and glances at the
<i>mainsail</i> (1), he should remember that the <i>head</i>
of the sail is that part fastened to the <i>gaff</i>; and the
<i>foot</i>, that part of the sail fastened to the <i>boom</i>. The
<i>outer-leach</i>, or <i>after-leach</i>, that part of the sail
which extends from the end of the <i>gaff</i> to the end
of the <i>boom</i> farthest removed from the mainmast.
The <i>inner-leach</i>, or <i>luff</i>, is that part of the sail
which extends from the <i>gaff</i> to the <i>boom</i>, and is
confined to the <i>mainmast</i> by hoops that embrace
it, and allow of the sail being hoisted and lowered
at will.</p>

<p>The <i>clews</i> of a sail are those parts which a "land-lubber"
might call corners; i.e., the clews of the
mainsail are four, and are situated at the junction
of the <i>luff</i> and <i>head</i> of the sail, the <i>outer-leach</i> and
head of the sail, the <i>outer-leach</i> and foot of the
sail, and the <i>luff</i> and <i>foot</i> of the sail; the latter
being also called the <i>tack</i>.</p>

<p>The mainsail, as will be observed, has also a
series of regular lines crossing its surface. These
are called <i>reef-points</i>, and consist of short, dangling
pieces of small rope, sewed into the sail, and hanging
down on either side, long enough, when the
sail is lowered, to be fastened around the main-boom,
and thus tie down the sail, making it smaller
for rough weather, which is called "reefing." On
the <i>outer-leach</i>, at the end of these rows of <i>reef-points</i>,
are placed little iron rings, or <i>cringles</i>, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13">[13]</a></span>
they are called, which are used to pass a rope
through, called a <i>reef-pennant</i>, to haul the sail well
out on to the boom when being reefed. The rope
(a a) represents what is called the <i>topping-lift</i>, and
is used to lower or hoist the <i>main-boom</i>, so as to
make the sail set well in certain circumstances; or
when the <i>main-boom</i> is out over the water on one
side of the boat, when running before the wind, to
"<i>top it up</i>" so as to keep it out of the water when
the boat rolls. It is set up by means of a small
pulley, the end of the rope coming inboard through
a sheave in the boom, or one fastened to its side.</p>

<p>The <i>jib</i> has its <i>luff</i>, <i>head</i>, <i>foot</i>, and
<i>after-leach</i>, the same as the <i>mainsail</i>, but, of course,
has only <i>three clews</i>, being a triangular sail.</p>

<p>And what is defined about these sails will apply
to all fore-and-aft sails.</p>

<p>The most important ropes, to which the attention
of the reader is called, are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>main-sheet</i> (l) is a long rope fastened to
the main-boom, and controlling the action of the
mainsail. According to the size of the boat, this
sheet will be single, or rove through a series of
blocks, to enable the helmsman to handle the sail.
Upon the management of this sheet depends, in a
great measure, the safety of all boat-sailing. Its
perfect handling and adjustment call for the nicest
skill; for its slightest movement changes the whole
face of the canvas spread in the mainsail.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14">[14]</a></span>The <i>jib-sheets</i> (m) are fastened to the after<i>-clew</i>
of the jib at the foot of the sail, and are led aft on
both sides of the deck, so as to be within reach of
the helmsman, or those sitting in the after-part
of the boat. Like the <i>main-sheet</i>, they are used to
confine and trim down the <i>jib</i>, each being used on
the side on which it is desired to trim down the
sail.</p>

<p>The <i>outer-jib</i> is controlled in the same manner,
by two sheets, one being led aft on either side of
the deck.</p>

<p>The <i>mainsail</i> is hoisted by means of two sets of
ropes, called <i>throat</i> and <i>peak-halliards</i> (n).</p>

<p>These are fastened at the foot of the mast to
<i>cleats</i> when the sail is hoisted; the throat-halliards,
usually on the port side of the mast, and
the peak-halliards, on the starboard side of the
mast.</p>

<blockquote><p>N.B.&mdash;The term <i>starboard</i> is applied to any thing appertaining
to the right-hand side of a boat, with the observer
looking towards the bow. The term <i>port</i> (formerly, and
sometimes now, called <i>larboard</i>) is applied to any thing
appertaining to the left-hand side, and, thus once defined,
never changes.</p>

<p>Although the observer may go forward and look aft, the
starboard side is still the starboard side, although now on
his left hand. Hence sailors talk of the <i>starboard</i> anchor,
the <i>port</i> shrouds; "Ease off the <i>port</i> jib-sheet!" "Let go
the <i>starboard</i> flying-jib-sheet!" "Put your helm over to
<i>port</i>!" "Hoist those colors from the <i>starboard</i> side!"
"Let the boom go over to <i>port</i>!" "Get up that anchor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15">[15]</a></span>
which you will find below in the forecastle, on the <i>starboard
side</i>!" "Go about on the <i>port</i> tack!" &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>jib</i> (2) is hoisted by means of a rope, which
is called the <i>jib-halliards</i>, which is made fast to
the upper clew of the sail, and led through a block
at the <i>mainmast</i> head, and thence to the deck,
being "belayed" (i.e., made fast) to the mainmast
near the deck. This sail also has a small but useful
rope attached to it, called the <i>down-haul</i>, which
is fastened to the upper clew, and led down to a
small block at the bowsprit end, and thence in on
deck; and serves to haul the sail down after the
halliards have been cast off. The <i>flying-jib</i> (4) is
fitted with <i>halliards</i> and <i>down-haul</i> in the same
manner.</p>

<p>The <i>gaff-topsail</i> (3) is set by hauling out the <i>after-leach</i>
and <i>foot</i> to the end of the <i>main-gaff</i>, which
part of the gaff is called the <i>peak</i>, by means of a
rope, which is named the <i>gaff topsail-sheet</i>, which
reefs through a sheave in the <i>gaff</i> end, and hence
under the <i>gaff</i> to the throat, and thence through a
block to the deck. The other <i>clew</i>, formed by the
<i>luff</i> and foot, is stretched by means of a rope leading
to the deck, called the <i>tack</i>; and the sail is
hoisted by means of <i>halliards</i>, that reeve through a
block fastened at the <i>topmast</i> head, and thence
leading to the deck.</p>

<p>When the boat is under way, and pressed over by
the wind, the terms "starboard" and "port" are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16">[16]</a></span>
often exchanged for "leeward" and "windward,"
and, in fact, are the more commonly used in many
instances; although an old sailor would apply the
word "starboard" to certain things that he would
not apply the word "leeward" or "windward" to:
but these exceptions it would be hard to point out,
and they would be of little material use. Let it
suffice to say, that as a rule, when a boat is at
anchor or upright, the terms "starboard" and
"port" are used; whilst, when under way, the
terms "lee" or "leeward," "weather" or "windward,"
are more commonly used; for instance,
"Let go the weather jib-sheet!" "Haul aft the lee
flying jib-sheet!" "Haul that coil of rope over to
the weather-side (or to windward)!" "Throw that
hot water to leeward!" "Does she carry a weather-helm?" &amp;c.</p>

<p>Having learned the names of all the important
spars, sails, and ropes, and their uses, it becomes
necessary to study the other appurtenances of a
boat to acquire a thorough knowledge of boat-sailing;
and for that purpose we will pass briefly in
review the following.</p>

<h4>BALLAST.</h4>

<p>Nearly all yachts are made of such a model as to
need some heavy material placed within them to
enable them to carry sail, and stand up against sudden
squalls and flaws of wind. This material is
called <i>ballast</i>, and, as a self-evident rule, yachts that
are shallow, and of great breadth of beam, need
less than those of a deep and narrow model.</p>

<p>Many articles may be used for ballast, and a
yacht ballasted in many different ways; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18">[18]</a></span>
following-named are those that are most commonly
used. Pig-iron, in pieces that can be handled, is a
favorite kind of ballast: sometimes each piece is
painted, so as to preserve it from rusting, and discoloring
the inside of the boat. Iron in the form
of fifty-six-pound weights is also used; whilst a
cheaper and very common ballast is found in the
small clean pebbles of the seashore. Water contained
in movable tanks has been at times, with
some, a well-praised ballast; and in yachts where it
can be used, and that are fitted for it, it is of great
practical value, as, like no other, it can be discharged
and renewed by means of a pump, according
to the will and weather.</p>

<p>The slag from smelted copper and iron is extensively
used, as are also broken pieces of iron-casting.
But perhaps the ballast as commonly in use as any
other in medium-sized yachts and small boats, or,
at least, a part of the ballast, consists of common
sea-sand enclosed in canvas sacks of a not too
unwieldy size, that are movable about the bottom
of the boat by means of canvas handles, and can,
in emergency, be dumped bodily over into the sea,
thus relieving the yacht of so much dead weight.</p>

<p>Nearly all yachts that are ballasted, when filled
with water, will sink; and there have been many
ingenious ways devised to prevent this, so that,
in case a yacht should be swamped, i.e., completely
filled with water, she would yet float, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19">[19]</a></span>
make a sort of life-preserver to the occupants, and
not go to the bottom, and leave them struggling on
the surface.</p>

<p>A very ingenious and yet cheap way of obtaining
this result is to have built into the wings of the
yacht, under the floorings, and in every conceivable
place that is out of the way, empty tin or iron six-pound
powder-canisters, that seal hermetically, sufficient
in number to overcome, by the air they contain
and the natural buoyancy of the wood composing
the yacht, the weight of the ballast, or the
tendency of the same to sink the yacht when filled
with water. It will not take a great number of
these canisters in quite a large yacht of medium
model; for, although the yacht will sink without
them, it does not take very much of this confined
air to turn the scale, and make it float.</p>

<p>Some yachts are ballasted with lead; and this,
if it were not for its cost, is a prime ballast, taking
up less space than any other. And some care not
for the first cost; for, as is truly said, it is a marketable
article, which does not vary much in price:
and, even if it should cost quite a sum to ballast
one's yacht with lead, it is so much cash on hand,
and can always be taken out and sold at a moment's
notice. Besides the different kinds of ballast that
have been enumerated, there is also the living ballast,
that is to say, human beings, whom one can
place in different parts of the yacht to trim her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20">[20]</a></span>
in different situations. But this kind of ballast is
mostly used in racing, and even then is sometimes
apt to "get out of order," and not "work well;"
and the writer would advise one to stick to iron,
lead, gravel, or sand as superior.</p>

<p>Perhaps for bay and harbor sailing and short
cruises from port to port, there is nothing better
than the canvas bags of sand, which can be emptied,
if necessary, when one gets aground, or in any
other case of emergency, and filled again at the
very next shore upon which one lands in the little
tender.</p>

<p>As a rule, sailing-boats and small yachts are
"trimmed by the stern;" that is, the bow is
slightly elevated from the water, the boat being
pressed, by the position of its ballast, deeper into
the water at the stern than at the bow. But every
yacht is a law to itself; and no rule will do for all.
The position of the ballast has also much to do with
the steering qualities, as well as affecting speed: if
it be placed too far forward, the yacht will "yaw,"
and at times, before the wind, be almost unmanageable.
In "going about," also, if the ballast be too
far forward, the boat will often "miss stays;" that
is, fail to perform the evolution of getting upon the
other tack.</p>

<p>Misplaced ballast will also cause the yacht to
carry the helm in a bad position, stopping her
speed. Bringing a yacht "by the head" with too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21">[21]</a></span>
much ballast is a serious, nay, at times, a dangerous
fault. Bringing her too much by the stern, by means
of ballast, is not so grave a matter: the yacht may
lose in speed, and not be in her best trim; but she
is not as dangerous or unmanageable. It is always
better to have too much ballast than too little. It
is very easy to ballast a boat with sand or pebbles
before one starts; but they cannot be obtained after
having once gotten under way; and from this simple
cause have arisen so many disasters that need
never have occurred! One's natural pride, and the
desire to sail fast, prevent often the taking on
board of the necessary amount; and then, when it
suddenly comes on to blow, the yacht is found to
be crank, perhaps dangerously so. How much
better would it be to have a little too much ballast,
which, when homeward bound,&mdash;if there is need
of haste, and the weather be settled,&mdash;can be discharged
over the side, increasing her speed!</p>

<p>It is only by careful study that one can ascertain
just the amount of ballast that is needed; but, once
found, do not change it for light or heavy weather,
but keep it intact, and you and your boat will soon
understand each other much better than will be
the case if it be continually changed. A happy
medium is what must be sought for in the question
of ballast; for, of course, in different weathers different
amounts would be in order. But be advised,
and be on the safe side: have plenty of ballast, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22">[22]</a></span>
the speed is not the very fastest that the boat is
capable of making.</p>

<p>Professional boatmen, lobstermen, and fishermen
are never eternally shifting and changing their ballast:
having found the "happy medium," they let
it alone for the season. It is only the amateur that
is continually sailing his yacht upon her "beam-ends,"
or watching with the utmost anxiety the fast
approaching squall, for which the professional cares
naught.</p>

<h4>KNOTS.</h4>

<p>We cannot get along on board of a yacht without
knowing how to make a few useful knots.</p>

<p>The great beauty of a knot, in a sailor's estimation,
is not only to hold well, but to be easily <i>untied
or cast off</i> after having been subjected to a great
strain. Of all knots the bowline is, perhaps, the
king, because it can be submitted to a strain that
will part the rope, before slipping or giving in the
least (and this holds true of the largest hawser, as
well as the smallest line); and, after this strain is removed,
it can be untied as easily as a knot in one's
summer neck-tie. It can be very quickly made, and
is useful in more situations than any other, and
can be used to replace many others. It is used
to fasten a rope in a hurry to the ring of an anchor,
or to make fast the painter of a tender through a
ring-bolt securely for towing, and yet so as to be
easily cast off; fastening sinkers upon fish-lines, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23">[23]</a></span>
the end of any rope in a position where it will bear
strain. Flags may be bent on with this knot, although
sailors have a signal-halliard knot, as they
also have a peculiar bent for fastening a hawser to
an anchor; but no knot can be used in an emergency,
in place of all these, like the bowline; and,
if one can have knowledge of but a few, let the
bowline be the first acquired. It will be useful also
on shore, and throughout one's life, making as a
matter of past record, to be eternally sunk in oblivion,
those awful knots that never would come undone
again. Next to the bowline in importance is,
perhaps, the bend called <i>two half-hitches</i>, or the
<i>clove hitch</i>, by means of which one can secure
with the end of a rope almost any thing. This
hitch is called two half-hitches when it is made
upon its own standing part, and a clove hitch when
made around any other thing, such as a spar; but
both are the same in principle.</p>

<p>The third knot that must be acquired is what is
called the <i>square knot</i>, or reef knot, and is used in
reefing the sails. The reef-points being tied in
square knots can be easily untied when needed:
if improperly tied in a <i>granny knot</i>, they either jam
or fly open in the height of the gale,&mdash;when one
desires them most to hold on.</p>

<p>With these three knots one can get along nicely,
and it is advisable to obtain a knowledge of how to
make them without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h4>TO MAKE A BOWLINE KNOT.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 15%;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Bowline knot" /></div>

<p>Take the end of the rope in your right hand, and
the standing part in your left; lay the end over the
standing part; then with your left
hand turn the bight of the standing
part from you, and over the
end part, by a peculiar turn of the
wrists, which comes only by practice,
forming what is called a goose-neck
on the standing part; then
lead the end, which is already enclosed
in the goose-neck, under and
around the standing part, and down
through the same goose-neck; and haul the parts
taut.</p>

<h4>TO MAKE TWO HALF-HITCHES.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 28%;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Half-hitches" /></div>

<p>Pass the end of the rope around the standing
part, and up through
the bight (this is one
half-hitch); pass the
end again around the
standing part, and up
through its own bight,
which makes the second
half-hitch, and
completes the knot.
(See diagram.) Then,
if this knot is used to bend on a hawser to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25">[25]</a></span>
anchor, it is customary to stop the end of the rope
down upon the standing part by means of a rope-yarn,
so as to prevent all chance of its coming
apart whilst chafing about at the bottom of the sea.
<i>A clove hitch</i> is this same knot made around a
spar or other article, instead of on its own standing
part. (See diagram.)</p>

<h4>TO MAKE A SQUARE OR REEF KNOT.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 28%;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Reef knot" /></div>
<p>First make a common overhand knot around a
spar, or any thing that may suit; then make exactly
the same knot again, taking care to cross the ends
so that they will each come out on the same side
of the bight as they did in the first
knot. If on either side of what may
be called the right or left side of the
knot, as seen in the cut, the ends do
not come out in the same relative
place as in the first knot, it is called a "granny
knot," and will not hold. And one who makes a
"granny" becomes the laughing-stock of all on
board, and is at once pronounced a "land-lubber,"
if he cannot make this simple and useful knot correctly.
So be advised, and learn it at once.</p>

<h4>THE ANCHOR AND GEAR.</h4>

<p>Nothing on board the yacht, after the sails and
ropes, should receive such attention as the "ground
tackle," as it is called. On the anchor and its appurtenances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26">[26]</a></span>
rests the safety, often, of all on board;
and yet there is nothing so often neglected, or left
carelessly out of order, or the cable in a snarl, as
the anchoring gear in a small yacht.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Anchor" /></div>

<p>Every yacht over twenty-five feet in length should
be fitted with three anchors, or, at the very least,
two. If three in
number, two of
them should be
nearly of the same
size, and one quite
small and handy,
which is called the
"kedge-anchor."
We will suppose
that the yacht is
fitted with three,
and, if so, their
uses will be as hereinafter
described.</p>

<p>In the olden
times hemp cables
were wholly used,
even for vessels of
large size and men-of-war;
but in these
latter days they have been replaced by iron cables
in large ships, and by manila hawsers in small
yachts. To be sure there are some advantages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27">[27]</a></span>
in favor of a chain-cable for even small yachts;
but as a rule the pliable, soft but strong manila
rope is the favorite. Small iron cables are, for some
reason or other, distrusted; and they are also heavy
to get back again, even if of small size, when the
yacht is anchored in many fathoms of water. They
are useful when the yacht is likely to lie at anchor
in a sea-way for a long time, for then they
would not chafe; whilst a manila cable might become
seriously injured. Some use a few fathoms
of iron chain, and then manila above that, so as
to keep the end near the anchor from fraying on
rocky bottoms. It is to be remembered, then, in a
long piece of chain cable, that the <i>one imperfect
link</i>, or one that is weak in any way, <i>determines the
utmost strength of the cable</i>. In other words, the
strain necessary to part the weakest link makes the
stronger ones useless. Perhaps it is the fear of this
weakness lurking in some unknown link that deters
yachtsmen, as a class, from using chain-cables, and
makes them prefer the clean, handsome manila rope,
that they know is just as strong at one part as another
throughout its entire length.</p>

<p><i>Wire cables</i> have commenced to be talked of,
made in the same shape as wire rigging, only more
pliable; and these, perhaps, will, in time, come into
use, as they are of uniform strength, and take up
less room than the cumbersome manila rope cables.</p>

<p>If the anchors are stowed below deck, always get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28">[28]</a></span>
them up, and bent on to their respective cables,
long before the time when it becomes necessary to
use them. One never knows, near a coast-line,
when an anchor may be needed.</p>

<p>Always have good long cables, and not nasty
little pieces of short rope: on this depends often
the safety of all concerned. Every thing else being
equal, the length of the cables is what will determine,
in a gale of wind, whether the yacht goes on
shore a wreck, or gallantly and safely weathers the
storm.</p>

<h4>TO ANCHOR IN A GALE OF WIND.</h4>

<p>If caught in a gale of wind on a lee-shore, and
with no chance of escape,&mdash;the sea being too
heavy to "claw off" to windward, and no harbor
to leeward,&mdash;the only safety is to anchor; and
always do this before it is too late, and before the
yacht has been driven too near the shore or breakers
to lie quietly. Procrastination at such a time
is often highly dangerous; and a yacht may go
ashore because she is anchored in a line of heavy
breakers, when just outside she would lie almost
with ease.</p>

<p>It will be found, also, that it <i>always</i> takes longer
to get an anchor down than was estimated, and
whilst it is being done the yacht sets heavily in
towards the shore with each sea: therefore anchor
<i>early</i>. When every thing is ready, bring the yacht
to the wind, and let the sails shake in the wind's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29">[29]</a></span>
eye; and, so soon as she gets stem-way, let
go the best bower anchor, taking care not to snub
her too quickly, but to let considerable of the cable
run out before checking her; then take a turn or
two around the knight-heads, long before there is
any strain, and be ready to give her cable gradually
as she needs it. One must be very careful to get
this turn around the knight-heads long before
there is any strain; for the strength of the yacht
drifting before the gale will be under-estimated,
except by a sailor; and if one has neglected to
take the necessary turn in time, and a strain once
commences upon the cable, it will then be too late,
and the mortification will be experienced of seeing
the whole cable go overboard, unless the yacht be
brought up by its being fastened below; and even
then the chances are, that it will be snapped
asunder by the momentum that the drifting yacht
has acquired.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="An Anchor backed" /></div>

<p>Just so soon as the first anchor bites, and the
yacht seems to come head to wind, and hold, let go
the second anchor, and pay out plenty of cable on
both, keeping the strain as nearly equal on each as
possible. In grave circumstances like these of
anchoring in a gale of wind on a lee-shore, it is
always well to put down both anchors. Too often
one anchor is used, because the weather does
not look very bad, and, as it increases, the cable is
paid out upon; and when, at last, it is ascertained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30">[30]</a></span>
that the gale has increased, and another anchor is
needed, it is found, after it is cast, that the cable
cannot be paid out upon it, because the end of
the cable of the first anchor is close at hand, and
has been nearly all paid out, making the second
anchor useless. Always let go both anchors, one
shortly after the other; and if the weather be very
bad indeed, then, when about half the cable is paid
out on the second anchor, lash to the cable the
small kedge-anchor, by fastening it by small ropes,
passed around the shank and through the ring, to
the cable of the large anchor, and cast it over the
bows. This is called "backing an anchor" (see
diagram below), and strengthens the hold of the first
anchor in a marked degree, especially if the holding-ground
be poor. It is supposed, of course,
that, as the yacht comes head to wind, the jib is
hauled down; and now the next thing is to down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31">[31]</a></span>
mainsail, and furl every thing snug. If the yacht
holds well, keep part of the cables still on board,
to pay out, if necessary; and, to be sure that she is
not dragging, cast a hand-lead over the side, and
let it rest on the bottom. Make it fast, leaving
enough slack so that the yacht may sheer without
moving it. By trying this once in a while, it will
be instantly seen, from its relative position between
the yacht and the bottom, whether the vessel has
dragged. For instance, if the lead-line should be
left up and down, and the next time it was tested
should be found resting on the bottom, toward the
bow of the yacht, she would have dragged just that
distance, and needs more cable at once. It is well
always to give a good scope in such emergencies,
and allow the anchors to become embedded at a
good angle, and not be played with by just holding,
and then dragging a little, and then paying out a
little: that is dangerous sport. After all is furled
snug, nothing else can be done for safety, except
in case of extreme emergency, when, as a last recourse,
the mainmast may be cut away if the yacht
is dragging on shore. But with two good anchors
down in, say, six fathoms of water, and one of
those backed, and forty or fifty fathoms of cable
out, it will take a terrific sea and wind to make a
yacht budge an inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h4>GETTING THE ANCHOR, AND CASTING.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="Casting" /></div>

<p>Hoist the mainsail, and take the gaskets off the
jib, and see that the down-haul is cast off, and is
clear for hoisting; then heave away on the cable,
either by hand, or by windlass, if the yacht be large
enough to need one, till the anchor
is almost broken out of the
ground, or what sailors call, the cable,
"up and down;" then, by means
of the rudder, if in a tide-way, cast
the head of the yacht in the direction
you wish to proceed upon;
trip the anchor; and run up the jib
as soon as it will draw. If there is
no tide-way to act upon the rudder,
then, before breaking out the anchor,
hoist the jib; and, if it is
desired to cast the boat upon the
port tack, trim down the jib-sheet to
port, and shove the main-boom well
out over the starboard quarter, and,
when the boat has a good sheer, trip the anchor;
and, when she has paid off enough, let go the port
jib-sheet, and trim down on the starboard-sheet,
and haul aft the main-boom, and proceed on your
way.</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33">[33]</a></span>
ANCHORING FOR FISHING.</h4>

<p>It is often needful to drop an anchor so as just
to hold the yacht stationary for a short time in
some known place, for the purpose of fishing; and
these places are almost always ledges of rock, which
foul and entangle the anchor, and it is often difficult
to weigh it again. To avoid this (if there is
not too much wind, and the yacht will lie easily),
instead of making the cable fast to the ring of the
anchor, make it fast with a clove hitch around both
arms at the crown, and lead it along the shank of
the anchor to the ring, to which attach it by means
of a small piece of spun yarn or twine that will
hold some strain, but which can be broken in case
of necessity. Then, when it is desired to get under
way again, and the anchor is found to be fouled,
bring enough strain, by means of the windlass or
otherwise, upon the cable to part the twine at the
ring; when the strain will come directly upon the
crown and flukes, and the anchor will almost
always be cleared. If it should not be, pay out
plenty of cable, and sail around or beyond it, and
all at once it will be found that it is cleared, and
can be weighed. In anchoring in this manner, it
is not, in light weather, necessary to lower the
mainsail, but simply to trim down the main-sheet
flat, or place the boom in a crotch made for that
purpose. The jib can be lowered; and hoisted
again when under way.
</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34">[34]</a></span>GROUNDING AND FLOATING.</h4>

<p>If the yacht takes the ground on any shoal, and
is left by the tide, it is always proper to get out an
anchor in the direction of the wind, before the tide
returns; then, when the water begins to make, the
yacht will not be blown higher and higher upon the
shoal as she commences to float, but will be held
by her anchor, and soon ride head to wind or tide.</p>

<h4>WARPING BY MEANS OF AN ANCHOR.</h4>

<p>There are times when it is desirable to get a
yacht into a certain position, and there is no wind.
To do this, run out a light anchor to the spot you
desire to reach, by means of a small tender; cast it
overboard; and warp the yacht up to it: repeat this
till the desired position is reached.</p>

<h4>A RUNNING MOOR</h4>

<p>Is sometimes made by casting an anchor, with
plenty of scope of cable, whilst a yacht is running
free, or before the wind, and bringing her with a
long sweep, up to and heading the wind, when another
anchor is let go also, and part of the cable
of the first anchor hauled in so that she will lie to
one anchor on the flood-tide, and the other on the
ebb-tide.</p>

<h4>THE HELM AND RUDDER</h4>

<p>Control the movement of the yacht through the
water, and serve to direct her course.</p>

<p>The rudder may be described as pieces of boards
or planks, in a line with the keel, hung upon pivots
at the stern of a vessel, in an
upright position, and extending
from the keel to the rail,
and having an attachment,
called a tiller or wheel, to
move it in either direction,
to the right or left, across the
line of the keel of the yacht. (See diagram.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Rudder &amp; Tiller" /></div>

<p>The tiller, which passes through the rudder-head,
is moved to the right or left; and this is termed
"moving the helm." For instance, "Move the
helm over to starboard," "Put the helm to starboard,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36">[36]</a></span>
that is to say, push the tiller over towards
the starboard side of the yacht, which will carry
the rudder to the port side of the yacht, and, if
under way, the bow will change direction towards
the left. In other words, when a vessel is under
way, and going ahead by her own momentum, or
anchored in a tide-way, the following rule always
holds good:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>To starboard the helm carries the head to port.</i></p>

<p><i>To port the helm carries the head to starboard.</i>
See diagrams, Figs. 1 and 2, page 37.</p>

<p>This is all reversed at a critical point in seamanship,
which should be carefully remembered; and
that is when a yacht has what is called a <i>stern-board</i>,
i.e., has received some force which is making her
go through the water stern first. This often happens
when an attempt has been made to tack, and
the execution of the man&oelig;uvre has seemed to fail:
it is then for a moment or two that the yacht will
often drift astern, keeping in the wind's eye, making
it uncertain whether or not she will yet "go
about." It is at this moment, whilst she is making
this stern-board, that a knowledge of the helm will
yet put her about by shifting the helm hard over
to the opposite side from where it was when the
attempt was made to go about. Remember not to
move the helm till the yacht has commenced making
stern-way, then this law applies:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>To starboard the helm carries the head to starboard.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37">[37]</a></span><i>To port the helm carries the head to port.</i></p>

<p>For instance, if it were desired to go about by
bringing the helm over to the starboard side of the
yacht, and the man&oelig;uvre
should fail, after the yacht
has come head to wind,
and commenced to get
stern-way, it might yet be
consummated by shifting
the helm, or tiller, over
to port, which would have
exactly the same effect as
it formerly had when the yacht was advancing, and
the helm hard a starboard.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 15%;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Starboard helm" /></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 15%;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Port helm" /></div>

<p>A yacht should be perfectly enough balanced
with sails and ballast to carry a nearly even helm
when on the wind: but it is often the case that
they carry what is called a <i>lee-helm</i>; that is to say,
when the yacht is on a wind, the tiller is continually
poked down to leeward, or the opposite side
of the yacht from the wind, to keep her up to
her course, from which a tendency to fall off is
shown: this is usually caused by too much head-sail,
and may be remedied by a shorter bowsprit, a
smaller jib, or another cloth on the after-leach of
the mainsail.</p>

<p>To carry a lee-helm is a "beastly thing," as an
Englishman would say, and something that cannot
long be endured by those who truly like yachting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38">[38]</a></span>
If the yacht is free from the odious lee-helm, she
may carry a <i>weather-helm</i>, which is not as bad as a
lee-helm, but is troublesome. This causes the yacht
to have a tendency to "luff up into the wind," and
causes the tiller to be carried hard over on the
weather-side of the yacht, and is usually occasioned
by too much after-sail, or bad storage of ballast.
Both these habits of carrying a lee, or weather-helm,
are detrimental to speed, as in both positions the
rudder is often held at nearly a right angle to the
keel, decreasing the speed materially. A yacht
that is well balanced in sails and ballast will, on a
wind, habitually carry the tiller a point or two to
windward of the line of the keel, and it will need
but little movement in any direction to keep her
on her course. Sometimes, in sudden squalls, a
yacht that carries a weather-helm will luff up into
the wind in spite of the helm, so as not to be
stopped except by slacking off the main-sheet. The
same may occur in yawing with a yacht that carries
a lee-helm. The helm may be put hard down, and
sometimes the jib-sheet will have to be eased off,
before the yacht will come to the wind. A weather-helm
is endurable, but a lee-helm never,&mdash;"<i>Well,
hardly ever.</i>"</p>

<h4>SHEETS.</h4>

<p>Sheets are the ropes that confine the mainsail
and jib in place, and are most important in their
uses. The jib-sheets lead along the deck, aft, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39">[39]</a></span>
the standing-room, in most yachts, and in heavy
weather should not be belayed so but what they
can be cast off in an instant by a sudden jerk of
the hand. They may be held in place by a sort of
hitch, hard to describe, where one part jams the
other, and keeps it in place. Any boatman will
explain how it is made. The main-sheet makes
fast, usually, at or near the helmsman, under whose
charge it is; <i>and in heavy weather this should
not be made fast at all</i>, but only one turn taken,
and the remainder of the strain rest upon the hand.
Of course, in yachts over thirty to forty feet in length,
with crews, every thing can be made fast: but we
are now writing of smaller craft, and it is repeated,
in squally and dirty weather <i>never make fast the
main-sheet</i>; it is the key to the whole science of
boat-sailing, and should never be out of one's hand
in time of emergency. It can, after taking one
turn, be wound around the tiller, and brought to
the same hand as the one that is moving the helm,
and yet be instantly cast off, if necessary.</p>

<h4>THE TOPPING-LIFT.</h4>

<p>This useful rope holds up the main-boom, and
its length is regulated by a pulley. In scudding
before the wind it is very useful; for, by means of
the pulley, the end of the boom can be "topped
up," so as to be kept out of the water when the
yacht rolls heavily. It is also useful in making the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40">[40]</a></span>
mainsail set well; and, after the latter is hoisted, it
can be made to set flat as a board by slacking the
topping-lift so that the after-leach of the sail will
wholly sustain the outer end of the main-boom.</p>

<h4>SPRINGING A LEAK, AND THE USE OF THE PUMP.</h4>

<p>The pump should always be kept in good order,
and ready for immediate use. In case the yacht
springs a leak, the best way to stop it is to pass
a light sail over the bows, and bring it aft over
the leak by means of ropes on both sides of the
yacht. Leaks are more easily stopped on the
outside, the pressure of the water forcing the canvas
into the damaged part; and even light canvas
is almost water-proof. Of course, after once having
thus temporarily stopped a leak, it is scarcely necessary
to add that one should seek shelter in the
nearest port, and have the yacht perfectly repaired
before proceeding farther; for there is nothing
more deceptive, or dangerous even, than a small
leak, which is almost always sure to open, and become
a source of great anxiety, just so soon as the
sea begins to get up and the wind to blow,&mdash;at the
very moment, in other words, when the yacht needs
all possible care and attention in other directions,
to insure her safety. Never neglect a small leak,
but have it attended to and repaired at once.</p>

<p>Examine the well of the yacht often, and ascertain
by personal inspection that she is not making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41">[41]</a></span>
water faster than is usual, and especially have this
attended to during rough weather. If a leak is
discovered, the yacht should, if possible, be put
before the wind till it is secured; for she will receive
less strain to hull and spars in this position
than in any other.</p>

<h4>CLOSE-HAULED.</h4>

<p>A yacht is said to be close-hauled, or sailing
"<i>full and by</i>" when she is brought as near to the
wind as is possible, so as to advance through the
water; for it is to be presumed that it is understood,
that if the main-boom were brought so as to pass
directly over the line of the keel of the yacht, and
the head of the yacht brought as near the wind as
possible, and the sail to remain full, and not shake,
she would not advance, but would simply be
pushed to leeward by the wind. To insure her
advancing, the boom must be at some angle from
the line of the keel: therefore it may be taken as
a rule that the main-boom, in sailing, is always kept
out over the quarter, on one side or the other; and
close-hauled simply means that it is brought as far
inboard, or towards the line of the keel, by means
of the main-sheet, as experience has proved can
be done, and have her advance through the water.
Some yachts haul aft the main-boom closer than
others, being enabled to do so on account of their
build and model; and the closer the boom can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42">[42]</a></span>
be brought to the line of the keel, and the yacht
still kept advancing, the nearer the wind she will be
said to sail, and will "hold a good wind," as it is
called. And this is, of course, a <i>desideratum</i> in
beating to windward, or against the wind at an
angle to it; for the yacht that makes the angle
least between itself and the direction of the wind
will, other things being equal, arrive the quickest
at its destination; whilst another, that cannot lie so
nigh the wind, will have to pass over much more
water to arrive at the same place. On general
principles, all fore-and-aft vessels lie equally near
the wind, usually within four points and a half;
but there are craft, that from their model, and
equal balance of sail, or some other unknown
cause, will lie nearer than their neighbors, and seem
to eat up into the wind.</p>

<p>Just how far to have the main-boom over the
side of the yacht, in sailing close-hauled, has never
been settled; for it resolves itself to this. If the
boom is hauled further inboard, the yacht sails
nearer to the wind, but in an increased ratio loses
its speed; for, if it should be hauled completely in
till in a line with the keel, the yacht would stop, as
has been explained: whilst, the farther out over the
side it is allowed to go, the faster the yacht sails,
but the farther also from the wind and the direction
that it is desired to proceed in to windward.
Hence a happy medium must be decided upon;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43">[43]</a></span>
and there is no doubt but what the result of most
races has depended more upon the use of the main
sheet, when close-hauled, or beating to windward,
than upon any other cause. Just how flat to trim
the sheets can only be acquired by experience; but
the following general rules will apply:&mdash;</p>

<p>As a general principle, the sheets can be trimmed
flatter, or farther aft, in light weather and a smooth
sea, than in heavy weather and a head sea. In
fact, it is impossible to sail as near the wind in
lumpy water as in smooth water. After a yacht
has been reefed, also, she will not lie as near the
wind as before, for the same reasons that compelled
the reefing.</p>

<p>With old hands, the yacht, when close-hauled,
is allowed to, what sailors call, "go through the
water," rather than to point up almost into the
wind's eye, and keep bobbing up and down, and
advancing very little. In most yachts it will be
found by experiment that the main-boom should
be at about the angle shown in the figure in the
diagram on p. 46, marked "close hauled;" but
others may be, perhaps, hauled slightly more inboard:
but, as a general law, a good free sheet is
the better, especially in a sea-way.
</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44">[44]</a></span>
TO KNOW WHEN THE YACHT IS AS NEAR THE WIND
AS SHE WILL SAIL</h4>

<p>Is important, and it can always be known by the
following method. Push the helm very slowly over
to leeward, and, as the yacht commences to come
towards the wind, keep the eye fastened upon the
luff, or inner leach, of the mainsail. As soon as
the yacht is too near the wind to have the sail stand
full, a little wave will be seen to agitate the luff of
the sail, from its head to the foot, usually commencing
near the head, and just under the gaff, as that
part of the sail is at a further angle from the wind
than the part that is fastened to the main-boom;
the gaff blowing out much further to leeward, not
being confined by a sheet as the main-boom is.
This wave, or shake, is caused by the wind getting
on both sides of the sail, and, if persisted in, would
bring the yacht to a stand-still, with the sail flapping
in the wind's eye. But short practice will enable
one to see almost instantly this commencement of
a shake, that begins to show itself on the mainsail
like a smile breaking over the countenance of a
pretty woman; and at the first symptom reverse the
helm, and keep the yacht in that position which is
called sailing "by the wind," or "full and by;"
that is to say, full sails, and by the wind. If, after
the yacht is in this position, a bearing on shore
can be taken to steer by, it will be a good thing;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45">[45]</a></span>
but as the wind often changes even several points,
especially near the coast-line, every few moments,
this experiment must be repeated; and it is this
keeping a yacht up to her work, and never letting
her fall off, and never shaking her, and yet taking
advantage of every flaw, that goes to make up the
accomplished helmsman. There are other signs
besides these, which to a sailor are very simple,
that denote to him when the yacht is off the wind;
such as the angle at which the wind strikes his
face, the direction of the wind on the face of the
waters, and the line of the weather-vane at the main
truck, and the smoke from his pipe: these will do
for him as well as luffing and shaking the mainsail,
but the latter method is the perfect one; and, if
the yacht can be so steered as to keep just the
suspicion of a little smile rippling its luff below the
throat of the gaff, it will be the perfection of sailing
"close-hauled," or "by the wind."</p>

<h4>RUNNING FREE.</h4>

<p>When the wind is favorable, and the yacht will
lay her course without having to beat towards her
destination at an angle against the head wind, as in
close-hauled, then the sails are arranged in a different
manner; and the main-boom is swung out
over the side in just such proportion as the wind
may be free, till completely out, so as to hang at
right angles with the keel, when the wind is dead
aft. (See diagrams.)
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="Running free" /></div>

<h4>BEFORE THE WIND, OR SCUDDING.</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the most difficult steering of any; and in
rough water it is very hard to keep the yacht upon
her course, for the reason that the seas will lift the
stern out of the water, thus at once neutralizing
the use of the rudder for a moment, and causing
the yacht to yaw. Besides this, the speed changes,
this affecting the rudder also. When on top of a
sea, and all the sails full, the yacht will go fast:
when she attempts to bury her head, and kick up
her heels, and becalms the jib and lower part of
the mainsail, she will go slower. There is one
thing to be guarded against in running before the
wind, and that is the "jibing" of the main-boom;
that is to say, the wind getting on the forward part
of the sail, from any cause,&mdash;whether by change of
wind, or on account of bad steering,&mdash;and carrying
it violently over to the other side, endangering the
yacht, and with a liability, in heavy weather, of
carrying away the mast. This must be guarded
against carefully; and if the sea is very bad, and
the yacht steers very wild, it is better to tack down
to leeward, as it is termed, that is to say, to haul
up the yacht a little towards the wind on either
tack, so as to bring it over the quarter, and then
run before it for a distance, and then, by careful
jibing, bring the wind over the other quarter, and
then proceed on.
</p>

<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48">[48]</a></span>PILOT'S LUFF.</h4>

<p>In harbor-sailing, a buoy or point often appears
ahead, which, if passed, the yacht could be at once
kept away free, being now close-hauled, thus saving
the time and inconvenience of tacking, but, as she
is going, will be right in the way, unless she is put
about. To avoid tacking in such a case, where
the yacht will <i>almost</i> stand by, a man&oelig;uvre is often
executed (if the tide is favorable, and the wind
brisk), to avoid tacking, called a "pilot's luff," and
consists of&mdash;when quite near the object to be passed,
and according to its position as right ahead or
slightly to leeward&mdash;bringing the yacht quickly
up into the wind, so that the sails shake, and by
her own momentum shooting her dead to windward
once or twice her length; and then, before
her headway is lost, and the rudder, therefore, useless,
keeping her off again till every thing draws,
when the same man&oelig;uvre may be again executed,
each time gaining a position farther to windward
than could have been gained in any other way,
except by going about on the other tack.</p>

<p>It takes a steady hand at the tiller, and a good
calculation of the momentum of the yacht, to execute
a pilot's luff well: but it is very useful often,
if well performed, and very disastrous in a race;
for instance, if the helmsman succeeds in getting
the yacht "into irons," and with a stern-board on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49">[49]</a></span>
as may be the case if he brings her up too high,
or neglects to move the helm in time to get back
upon his course before the momentum of the yacht
is lost, or lets her go about on the other tack. A
pilot's luff is a very pretty man&oelig;uvre when well
executed; and you shall see many an old boatman
squeezing his boat by a point, instead of taking the
trouble of going about, knowing, that, the moment
he has doubled it, his course will be such that the
wind will be fair, and he can then ease off his
sheets, and go on his way rejoicing.</p>

<h4>TACKING</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%;">
<img src="images/i013.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Tacking (1)" /></div>

<p>Is the art of putting a yacht
about, so that the wind, which
has been blowing upon the starboard
side, we will say, shall
blow upon the port side, or on
the opposite side of the sails to
which it was before the man&oelig;uvre
was executed, and, when
used to force the vessel by a
series of angles towards the
direction from which the wind
proceeds, is called "beating to
windward." Sometimes the
wind is not dead ahead, and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51">[51]</a></span>
in such a direction that the yacht cannot proceed
except by tacking once in a while. This is termed
<i>making a long and a short leg.</i> (See diagram.)</p>

<p>We will first explain how a yacht is put about in
heavy weather and with seamanlike accuracy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 25%;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Tacking (2)" /></div>

<p>In the first place, let us
define the starboard tack
from the port tack, and
<i>vice versa</i>. It must be remembered
that a yacht is
on the starboard tack when
the main-boom is out over
the port quarter, and the
port jib-sheets trimmed
down; and on the port
tack, when the main-boom
is out over the starboard
quarter; or the starboard
jib-sheets trimmed down; or
a yacht is said to be on the
starboard tack when the wind blows so as to hit the
starboard side of the boat, and <i>vice versa</i>. This is
very useful to remember; for there are several
"rights of way" that one has when on the starboard
tack, which will be treated of hereafter.
The windward side of the yacht also denotes which
tack she is upon, the name of the weather-side
being the name of the tack. We will suppose that
the yacht is on the starboard tack, with the main-boom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52">[52]</a></span>
out over the port quarter, the port jib-sheets
trimmed down, and the yacht close-hauled to the
wind. Have every thing gotten ready for tacking,
by singing out, <i>Ready about!</i> when all assistants
should take their positions as before instructed;
then (we will suppose you are steering your own
yacht) keep off till the yacht is going a good full
through the water, and then, by means of the tiller
gradually pressed hard over to port, bring her into
the wind's eye, singing out, as the tiller is being
moved, "<i>Hard a-lee</i>;" at which command the
assistant at the jib-sheet should cast off all but one
turn, and, as the boat starts into the wind, should
cast that off, letting the jib fly loosely at the command,
<i>Let go the jib-sheet!</i> which follows quickly
the announcement of "Hard a-lee." Then, unless
the yacht gets a stern-board, which has been explained
elsewhere, she is helped round by pushing
the main-boom&mdash;which is made fast by its sheet,
and works itself&mdash;out over the starboard quarter.
When the yacht is just about to pass the direction
of the wind, and is nearly upon the other tack, give
the order to "<i>trim down on the port jib-sheet</i>,"&mdash;the
same sheet as has just been cast off; and the
outer surface of the sail will act as a lever to push
the head of the yacht off till the wind fills the
mainsail, when the order, "<i>Let draw!</i>" should be
given, and the jib-sheet let go on the port side,
and trimmed down as fast as slacked, by another
assistant on the starboard side. (See diagrams.)

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="The Art of Tacking" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>When the weather is light, the yacht small, or
particularly easy in coming about, all the above
may not need to be executed. Some vessels will
come about without starting the head-sheets; others
always need it; some always get stern-way, and
need the helm shifted to bring them round; whilst
the centre-board boats, as a class, fly round without
touching any thing. But it is well to know how to
get a yacht about in a heavy sea; and all the principles
that will help bring about this result have
been given above.</p>

<h4>JIBING, OR WEARING.</h4>

<p>There are times when the sea is too high, and
the sail so much reduced that a yacht will not go
about by turning towards the wind, but must be
gotten on the other tack by wearing, as it is technically
called in ships, where the yards are square,
and jibing, as it is called in crafts that carry fore-and-aft
sails, i.e., sails that hoist up on a mast, and
are stretched upon booms, in contradistinction to
those that are fastened to yards that cross the mast
at right angles, as in a ship often called by sailors,
for this reason, a "square-rigger."</p>

<p>Jibing is at all times a delicate man&oelig;uvre, as
many have found out to their sorrow if they have
ever been careless. It is also a very deceptive
man&oelig;uvre, to any but sailors. How easy it is for
land-lubbers, after facing a good square breeze, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55">[55]</a></span>
think, when the yacht is kept away before it, that
the wind has gone down! And the writer has actually
brought his yacht to the wind again, to convince
one sceptic that it was the position of the yacht
<i>wholly</i> that caused all the change; which is extremely
marked, as all must allow. It is from this
treacherous smoothness, after so much buffeting
about when close-hauled, that all the mischief
occurs; for the boom often, if carelessly allowed to
jibe, will fill with wind, and, as it goes over, either
part the main-sheet, or carry away the mast, or do
other damage, sometimes of a very serious nature.
It is forgotten, also, in this man&oelig;uvre, that, when
the mainsail comes aft, there is a moment when it
flutters in the wind's eye; and the yacht, relieved
of its immense pressure, loses in a great measure
her momentum, and then, when the sail fills with a
rush, sufficient allowance for the loss of speed, and
the force of the hurrying wind that fills the great
mainsail, is not taken into account.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre must, however, be executed when
the yacht will not go about by turning to windward;
but it is advised to use this method as little as possible,
except in light summer airs in inner harbors,
when it may be executed with impunity and without
any danger of mishaps.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/i016.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="Dropping the peak" /></div>

<p>We will suppose a yacht is running before the
wind on the port tack, with the main-boom off to
its fullest extent; which is a position that she will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56">[56]</a></span>
reach in turning to leeward, from any other position,
either close-hauled or running free, before she can
be jibed. It is always safer, if the wind is at all
strong, "to drop the peak" before attempting the
evolution. "Dropping the peak" consists of letting
go the peak-halliards of the mainsail, so that the
outer clew and head of the sail, that is attached to
the gaff, will be lowered down so as to dangle
alongside of the mainmast, with the gaff pointing
to the deck. This makes of the mainsail, for the
time being, a sort of triangular or leg-of-mutton
sail, and takes off the leverage of the high part,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57">[57]</a></span>
that the wind might fill in jibing, and thus press
over the yacht dangerously. (See diagram.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="Jibing" /></div>

<p>After dropping the peak, commence hauling in
upon the main-sheet, keeping the yacht all the
time turned a very little towards the wind on the
port side, till the main-sheet is hauled chock aft,
and the main-boom almost amidships; then take a
good turn with it, and shift the helm gradually, till
the wind is on the starboard side slightly, and the
sail has filled with a slat upon that tack; when the
main-sheet may be slackened, the peak hoisted,
and the yacht kept on her course.</p>

<h4>BEATING TO WINDWARD IN A TIDE-WAY.</h4>

<p>It is very important at times to know how a current
sets; for, in beating to windward, it makes all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58">[58]</a></span>
the difference in the world often, which tack the
yacht is upon, and whether she is heading well up to
the tide, or crossing it at such an angle as to receive
its whole force; and, being swept to leeward, the
direction of the current will decide which tack to
keep the longer upon, and to make as short as
possible the tack that brings the keel at right angles
to the current. Manage the yacht, also, so that,
when the current or tide-way is faced in the place
of its greatest strength, the yacht shall be upon
the tack that nearly stems it, and that she shall be
placed upon the unfavorable tack only when she
approaches parts of the tide-way where the current
may be less strong. A knowledge of the direction
of a tide-way, and how to take advantage of it, has
won many a race.</p>

<h4>TO TAKE IN A JIB, AND FURL IT.</h4>

<p>It is best to first bring to by the wind; but the
jib can be taken in and furled, with the yacht in
different positions.</p>

<p>Stand by the jib-halliards, and have the down-haul
well manned, also the lee jib-sheet; then, at
the command, "Down jib!" or, "Let go the jib-halliards!"
or, "Take in the jib!" the halliards
are cast off, the lee jib-sheet eased off, and the
down-haul bowsed upon, till the head of the jib is
snug down to the boom, when it should be carefully
belayed, and the lee-sheet again made fast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59">[59]</a></span>
leaving a little slack for furling. Then lay out
upon the bowsprit, on the weather-side, and pick
up the sail from out to leeward, and furl it to the
bowsprit by means of gaskets, or stops, or in any
way that is arranged for, being careful, if the yacht
is pitching much, not to be thrown over the bowsprit
to leeward, if submerged in a sea; for the
person is suddenly lifted by a sea that may reach
only to the middle, and, if care is not taken,
pitched over the bowsprit and to leeward. Having
made every thing fast, lay in, and set taut the jib-halliards,
and belay them, and bring the after-clew
of the jib amidships, by setting taut on the starboard
and port jib-sheets, and belaying them, and coiling
down every thing snug.</p>

<h4>TO TAKE IN A MAINSAIL, AND FURL IT.</h4>

<p>Bring the yacht close to the wind, and haul the
main-sheet flat aft, and belay it carefully; for, if it
should get adrift whilst the sail was being furled,
some one might be knocked overboard. Then
stand by the throat and peak-halliards, and, at the
word "Lower away," ease away handsomely on
each, taking care not to let the peak drop too fast,
which, if done, sometimes causes the hoops to jam,
and the whole sail to stick, till the peak-halliards
are hoisted upon again to clear things. When the
sail is wholly down, make fast the halliards, and get
along on the weather-side of the main-boom, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60">[60]</a></span>
pick up the sail by what is called "skinning it;"
that is to say, not to haul it up bodily upon the
boom, but by repeatedly taking the canvas, and
shaking it towards one, it is finally rolled up so as
to lay snugly on the boom, to which it should be
fastened by gaskets. The main-boom should then
be lifted into a crotch, if one is used, and the throat
and peak-halliards hauled taut, and the main-sheet
again belayed, as it will have to be slacked to get
the crotch under the boom, and every thing coiled
up snug, and belayed.</p>

<h4>REEFING.</h4>

<p>This consists of the art of reducing the sails of a
yacht in heavy weather, so that she will not be top-heavy,
and be able to stand up bravely against the
coming blast. And here let the writer beg all
persons who desire to be advised at all, not to
delay reefing too long; and always put in two reefs
rather than one, if the weather looks very dirty.
Reefing before bad weather reaches one is quite
another thing than trying to reef down in the
middle of a thunder-storm in which one has been
caught by holding on too long.</p>

<h4>TO REEF A JIB, OR TAKE OFF THE BONNET.</h4>

<p>If fitted with a bonnet, instead of reef-points,
bring the yacht to the wind, lower away on the jib-halliards,
and bowse on the down-haul, and lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61">[61]</a></span>
the jib enough so as to bring the reef-cringle down
to the bowsprit; then, if a bonnet, unlace and cast
off, and, if reef-points, tie up the sail with them,
and lash the outer clew to the bowsprit, and cast
off the jib-sheet blocks, and hook the sister-hooks
into the reef-cringle; hoist up the sail, and trim it.</p>

<h4>TO PUT ONE REEF IN A MAINSAIL.</h4>

<p>Haul down the jib, bring the yacht to the wind,
haul the main-boom chock aft, and belay the sheet
carefully; lower away on the throat and peak-halliards
till the reef-band is down somewhat lower
than the main-boom; then, by means of the reef-pennant
rove through the reef-cringle on the outer-leach
of the sail, bowse the foot out on the boom,
and lash it fast by passing an earing through the
cringle, and around the boom by several turns, till
the clew of the sail is securely fastened; then pass
an earing from the reef-cringle in the luff of the
sail around the main-boom in the same manner, and
commence fastening the reef-points, either around
the main-boom, or to an iron jack-stay fastened to
the boom, or around the foot of the sail, according
as the yacht may be arranged, remembering to make
each knot a square knot, and not a "granny."</p>

<p>After the sail is half lowered in this manner, so
as to get at the reef-band, &amp;c., the yacht is kept
head to sea and "hove to," by placing the tiller
towards the lee-side of the yacht, or what is called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62">[62]</a></span>
"hard a-lee," where it is secured till the vessel is
reefed, and started again on her way. In reefing,
always haul out on the reef-pennant first, and
stretch the foot of the sail, and then lash the luff
next, and fasten the reef-points last.</p>

<p>When the points are all tied, hoist away on the
throat and peak-halliards, and set the sail.</p>

<h4>TO TAKE IN A SECOND REEF.</h4>

<p>Proceed in exactly the same manner, except that,
in first commencing to reef, two reefs can be taken
in one by lowering the sail to the second reef-band,
and proceeding in exactly the same manner as in
the first reef, except that the two extremities of the
sail are lashed at the second reef-band cringles;
and, in tying the reef-points, no notice is taken of
the first reef-points, but they are stowed with the
rest of the sail to the boom, and are not tied. This
taking two reefs in one is often done when caught
suddenly and a great reduction of sail is needed
at once; and it is as useful and safe as if one reef
above the other had been properly tied, the only
difference being, that if the weather should moderate,
so that the yacht would need but one reef, instead
of the two she has in, nothing can be done,
till the weather is enough settled to carry all sail,
towards shaking out the two reefs in one, which
would, of course, shake out the whole sail: and
valuable time may be lost for want of more sail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63">[63]</a></span>
set; but, if it is really needed, the two reefs in
one can be cast out, and a single reef taken in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" style="width: 80%;" alt="Reefed sails" /></div>

<h4>TO SHAKE OUT A REEF.</h4>

<p>Bring the yacht to the wind in the same manner
as for reefing, and unknot carefully all the reef-points
<i>first</i>, then cast off the lashing at the luff, and,
lastly, the earing at the end of the boom.</p>

Sailing, and the Rules of the Road.&mdash;Fog-Signals.&mdash;Salutes.&mdash;Dipping
Colors.&mdash;Coming alongside.&mdash;Quarterdeck Etiquette.&mdash;Useful
Articles of Cabin Furniture.&mdash;Anchor Watch.&mdash;Method

<h4>SIGNAL-LIGHTS.</h4>

<p>In all night sailing it is important to know the
direction in which any passing vessel is proceeding,
and also to be able to give notice of the direction
in which one's own yacht is sailing, or, if she be at
anchor, to so denote, so as to avoid collisions; and,
for this purpose, law and custom have made certain
fixed rules, the most important of which, and those
that are necessary for usual contingencies, are here
appended.</p>

<h4>RULES OF THE ROAD; OR, STEERING AND
SAILING RULES OF THE UNITED STATES.</h4>

<div style="font-size: smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Article 2.</span>&mdash;The lights mentioned in the following articles,
and no others, shall be carried in all weathers between
sunset and sunrise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h5>LIGHTS FOR STEAMSHIPS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span>&mdash;All steam vessels, when under way, shall carry</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) At the foremast head a bright white light, so fixed as
to show a uniform and unbroken light over an arc of the
horizon of twenty points of the compass; so fixed as to throw
the light ten points on each side of the ship, viz., from right
ahead to two points abaft the beam on either side; and of
such a character as to be visible on a dark night, with a clear
atmosphere, at a distance of at least five miles.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) On the starboard side a green light, so constructed as
to throw a uniform and unbroken light over an arc of the
horizon of ten points of the compass; so fixed as to throw
the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on
the starboard side; and of such a character as to be visible
on a dark night, with a clear atmosphere, at a distance of at
least two miles.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) On the port side a red light, so constructed as to
show a uniform, unbroken light over an arc of the horizon
of ten points of the compass; so fixed as to throw the light
from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port
side; and of such a character as to be visible on a dark
night, with a clear atmosphere, at a distance of at least two
miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.<i>To fix firmly in the mind the side of the vessel on which
the lights belong, the following, although original, is recommended</i>:
<span class="smcap">Port wine</span> <i>is red, and the</i> RED LIGHT <i>is always on the</i>
PORT SIDE.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) The said green and red side-lights shall be fitted with
inboard screens, projecting at least three feet forward from
the light, so as to prevent these lights from being seen across
the bow.</p>

<h5>LIGHTS FOR STEAM-TUGS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span>&mdash;Steamships, when towing other ships, shall
carry two bright white masthead lights vertically, in addition
to their side-lights, so as to distinguish them from other
steamships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h5>LIGHTS FOR SAILING-VESSELS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span>&mdash;Sailing-vessels under way, or being towed,
shall carry the same lights as steamships under way, with
the exception of the white masthead lights, which they
shall never carry.</p>

<h5>EXCEPTIONAL LIGHTS FOR SMALL SAILING-VESSELS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span>&mdash;Whenever, as in the case of small vessels during
bad weather, the green and red lights cannot be fixed,
these lights shall be kept on deck, on their respective sides
of the vessel, ready for instant exhibition; and shall, on the
approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited on their respective
sides in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such
manner as to make them most visible, and so that the green
light shall not be seen on the port side, nor the red light on
the starboard side. To make the use of these portable
lights more certain and easy, they shall each be painted outside
with the color of the light they respectively contain,
and shall be provided with suitable screens.</p>

<h5>LIGHTS FOR SHIPS AT ANCHOR.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span>&mdash;Ships, whether steamships or sailing-ships,
when at anchor in roadsteads or fairways, shall, between
sunset and sunrise, exhibit where it can best be seen, but at a
height not exceeding twenty feet above the hull, a white
light in a globular lantern of eight inches in diameter, and
so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken
light visible all around the horizon, and at a distance of at
least one mile.</p>

<h5>LIGHTS FOR PILOT-VESSELS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 8.</span>&mdash;Sailing pilot-vessels shall not carry the lights
required for other sailing-vessels, but shall carry a white
light at the masthead, visible all around the horizon; and
shall also exhibit a flare-up light every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h5>LIGHTS FOR FISHING-VESSELS AND BOATS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 9.</span>&mdash;Open fishing-boats and other open boats shall
not be required to carry side-lights required for other vessels,
but shall, if they do not carry such lights, carry a lantern
having a green slide on the one side, and a red slide on the
other side; and, on the approach of or to other vessels, such
lantern shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision;
so that the green light shall not be seen on the port
side, nor the red light on the starboard side. Fishing-vessels
and open boats when at anchor, or attached to their
nets, and stationary, shall exhibit a bright white light.
Fishing-vessels and open boats shall, however, not be prevented
from using a flare-up light in addition, if considered
expedient.</p>

<h4>RULES GOVERNING FOG-SIGNALS.</h4>

<h5>FOG-SIGNALS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 10.</span>&mdash;Whenever there is a fog, whether by day or
night, the fog-signals described below shall be carried and
used, and shall be sounded at least every five minutes,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Steamships under way shall use a steam-whistle
placed before the funnel, and not less than eight feet from
the deck.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Sailing-vessels under way shall use a fog-horn.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Steamships and sailing-ships, when not under way
shall use a bell.</p>

<h4>STEERING AND SAILING RULES.</h4>

<h5>TWO SAILING-SHIPS MEETING.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 11.</span>&mdash;If two sailing-ships are meeting end on, or
nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, the helms
of both shall be put to port, so that each may pass on the
port side of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h5>TWO SAILING-SHIPS CROSSING.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 12.</span>&mdash;When two sailing-ships are crossing so as to
involve risk of collision, then, if they have the wind on
different sides, the ship with the wind on the port side shall
keep out of the way of the ship with the wind on the starboard
side, <i>except</i> in the case in which the ship with the
wind on the port side is close-hauled, and the other ship
free, in which case the latter ship shall keep out of the way.
But if they have the wind on the same side, or if one of
them has the wind aft, the ship which is to windward shall
keep out of the way of the ship which is to leeward.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<h5>SAILING-SHIP AND SHIP UNDER STEAM.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 15.</span>&mdash;If two ships, one of which is a sailing-ship
and the other a steamship, are proceeding in such directions
as to involve risk of collision, the steamship shall keep out
of the way of the sailing-ship.</p>

<h5>SHIPS UNDER STEAM TO SLACK SPEED.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 16.</span>&mdash;Every steamship, when approaching another
ship so as to involve risk of collision, shall slacken her
speed, or, if necessary, stop and reverse; and every steamship
shall, when in a fog, go at a moderate speed.</p>

<h5>VESSELS OVERTAKING OTHER VESSELS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 17.</span>&mdash;Every vessel overtaking any other vessel shall
keep out of the way of the said last-mentioned vessel.</p>

<h5>CONSTRUCTION OF ARTICLES 12, 15, AND 17.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 18.</span>&mdash;When, by the above rules, one of two ships
is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course,
subject to the qualifications contained in the following
article:&mdash;</p>

<h5>PROVISO TO SAVE SPECIAL CASES.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 19.</span>&mdash;In obeying and construing these rules, due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69">[69]</a></span>
regard must be had to all dangers of navigation, and due
regard must also be had to any special circumstances which
may exist in any particular case, rendering a departure
from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate
danger.</p>

<h5>NO SHIP UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO NEGLECT
PROPER PRECAUTIONS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 20.</span>&mdash;Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any
ship, or the owner or master, or crew thereof, from the consequences
of any neglect to carry lights or signals, or of
any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the neglect of
any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice
of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.</p>
</div>

<p>The following diagrams are designed to illustrate
the use of the lights carried by vessels at sea as
prescribed in the Regulations above, and the manner
in which they indicate to each vessel the position
and course of the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span> (when the <i>red</i> and <i>green lights</i> are both
seen).&mdash;A sees a <i>red</i> and <i>green</i> light ahead.
A knows that a vessel is approaching him on a
course directly opposite to the one he is steering,
as B. If A sees a <i>white masthead light</i> above the
<i>red</i> and <i>green lights</i>, he knows that the vessel B is a
steamer. A should put his helm to port; and B,
seeing the same lights on board of A, should by the
same rule put his helm to port also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span> (when the <i>red light</i> only is seen).&mdash;A
sees a <i>red light</i> ahead or on the port bow. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71">[71]</a></span>
knows that either, first, a vessel is approaching him
on his port bow, as B, or, second, a vessel is crossing
his bows to port in some direction, as D D' D"
(Fig. 3). If A sees a <i>white masthead light</i> above
the <i>red light</i>, he knows that the vessel is a steamer,

B (Fig 2), or is crossing to port in the same direction
as D D' D" (Fig. 3).</p>

<p>In the first position (Fig. 2) A sees B a little on
the port bow, B's <i>red light</i> exposed, and, by the
diagrams, B should see A's <i>red light</i> as well; in
which case both vessels should put their helms to
port.</p>

<p>In the second position (Fig. 3) A sees D on his
starboard bow, and, from the fact that he only sees
D's <i>red light</i>, he knows that D must be steering in
some direction, as at D D' D"; at the same time,
D D' D" will see A's <i>green light on his port bow</i>.</p>

<p>In this case, A, having D clearly on his starboard
bow, should put his helm to starboard to turn from
D, and D, having A clearly on his port bow, should
put his helm to port to turn to starboard from A.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span> (when the <i>green light</i> is seen, and the
<i>red light</i> is not seen).&mdash;A sees a <i>green light</i> ahead,
or on his bow. A knows that either, first, a vessel is
approaching him on his starboard bow, as B, or,
second, that a vessel is crossing his bow in some
direction to starboard, as D D' D" (Fig. 5).</p>

<p>If A sees a <i>white masthead light</i> above the

and is either approaching him in the same direction
as B, or is crossing to starboard in some
direction, as D D' D".</p>

<p>In the <i>first position</i> A sees B on his starboard
bow, B's <i>green light</i> exposed, and, by the diagram,
B should see A's <i>green light</i> as well; in which case
both vessels should put their helms to starboard.</p>

<p>In the <i>second position</i> A sees D on his port bow,
and, from the fact that he only sees D's <i>green light</i>,
he knows that D must be steering in some direction,
as D D' D"; at the same time D will see A's
<i>red light</i> on his starboard bow. In this case A,
having D clearly on his port bow, should put his
helm to port to turn from D; and D, having A
clearly on his starboard bow, should put his helm
to starboard to turn to port from A.</p>

<h4>SALUTES.</h4>

<p>When lying in harbor in a well-ordered and disciplined
yacht, considerable ceremony is made in
hauling down the colors at sunset, and hoisting
them at sunrise. It is customary to have this done
with great exactness, and to the very minute often,
at which the sun rises or sets, as ascertained by the
nautical almanac, at the discharge of a swivel or
small cannon; when all the colors aloft, including
the ensign and private signal, should commence to
descend towards the deck together, and at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73">[73]</a></span>
rate of speed. To execute this graceful ceremony
it becomes necessary to post two hands at each of
the signal-halliards,&mdash;one to haul down the color,
the other to check it on its descent, so as to have
it move with the same speed as the ensign, by
which all other colors are regulated; then, with two
hands to each flag, with the signal-halliards cast off,
and every thing clear, and ready to lower away,
another hand is placed at the swivel, and when the
second-hand of one's watch touches the minute of
sunset, the command "Fire!" is given, and down
drop gracefully and slowly all the colors that are
aloft. They may be set in the morning in the
same way, or may be made up in a bundle on deck,
and hoisted to their position aloft, when at a given
signal, or discharge of a cannon, the stop is jerked
asunder, and they are unfolded to the breeze at the
same instant of time. This is a more graceful
method than hoisting them up from deck, which, at
the best, causes a jerky movement of the bunting.</p>

<p>In a sloop-yacht the ensign is carried always at
the end of the gaff, when hoisted; and the burgee,
or private signal, at the topmast head.</p>

<p>When passing a vessel at sea that has her colors
set, it is always courtesy to bend on one's own, and,
as the nearest point is reached, lower the ensign
half way towards the deck, and then hoist it back
again to its position at the peak. This is called
"dipping the colors;" and the smaller vessel
should always be the one to offer the courtesy first.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74">[74]</a></span>If a man-of-war is met, care should be taken to
be always the first; and here it is proper to dip
one's ensign three times, as is it also to any large
and important vessel, such as an European steamer
moving along in all her majesty: she will not
neglect to answer the politeness.</p>

<p>In entering harbor, especially if there are other
yachts lying at anchor, it has become customary, at
the same moment that the anchor is dropped, to
discharge a gun announcing one's arrival; and, if
there are other yachts present to whom the yacht is
known, she will receive probably a salute from each
in return.</p>

<p>In coming alongside of a yacht at anchor, all
persons who are not guests of the captain, or
especially invited, or of some rank or consequence,
should come to the port gangway. The starboard side
of a vessel at anchor is the captain's side, as is
that side of the deck which is the windward-side
when she is under way. Ladies always come on
board on the starboard side, if the yacht be large
enough to enter into all these niceties of quarterdeck
etiquette.</p>

<p>Every yacht that is large enough to admit of it
should be fitted with a ship's clock with watch
movement, a swinging-lamp, and an aneroid barometer;
all of which are of great use,&mdash;the clock
to give the time which courses have been sailed;
the lamp, light to the chart upon the table; and the
barometer, admonition of a change in the weather.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75">[75]</a></span>It is of great importance that an "anchor-watch,"
as it is called, should be kept on all yachts, for
many reasons. For instance, to see that none of the
sails get adrift in the night, should it come on to
blow; and to see that the anchor holds well, or
to pay out more cable, if necessary; to watch the
lantern in the fore-rigging, and take care that it
does not go out, leaving the yacht at the mercy of
the first lumber-man that may come pitching into
her.</p>

<p>Do not anchor too near the shore, so that good
sea-room cannot be obtained, should it be desired
to get under way, to run out of the harbor, or to
pay out cable to hold on.</p>

<p>It is very easy to row to the shore in a tender,
with the yacht well out, but very hard to make an
inch sometimes, when it becomes a lee-shore.</p>

<p>These may seem trivial matters to be so careful
about; but it is looking out for all contingencies,
and yet being without a particle of fear, that makes
the true yachtman,&mdash;always ready, and every thing
always on hand. It is for this very reason of being
prepared, that fear is driven out; whilst, with the
careless one, in times of emergency the ropes foul,
the gaskets are missing, the anchor is not bent
on, the lamp wants oil, the lead-line can't be found,
and the jib-halliards, not being properly belayed and
coiled down, unreve from the masthead block,
and every thing is "at sixes and at sevens."</p>

<h4>CROSS-BEARINGS.</h4>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing more useful in simple
coast-sailing and entering harbors than to know
how to find one's exact position upon the chart, at
a moment's notice, by means of taking what is
called <i>cross-bearings</i>. Nothing is necessary for
this purpose, but a pair of parallel-rulers, a compass,
and a sight of any two well-defined objects in
view, that may be known upon the chart by their
general relative positions, such as lighthouses, lightships,
buoys, churches, headlands, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>parallel-rulers</i> are two rulers attached by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77">[77]</a></span>
means of two brass swivels, so that they can be
moved over the surface of a chart in any parallel
direction to that from which they are first started;
and are used to define direction upon any part of
the chart. For instance, being placed upon the
printed compass upon the chart, say upon the line of
N.W. and S.E., they can be moved about the chart,
carrying this same direction N.W. and S.E., to any
other part of the chart. The two objects decided
upon to be taken should be in such a direction as
to form somewhat nearly a right angle with the
yacht to obtain the most perfect results. All depends
upon the aptitude with which the observer
can <i>line</i> the object to be observed, i.e., its bearing
by compass.</p>

<p>The writer knows of nothing so important and
useful as this simple method of knowing just
where one is at any moment, and thus be enabled
to know just how to steer to avoid all dangers.
These sights, or cross-bearings, can be taken every
ten minutes with ease in fine weather, and the position
of the yacht exactly defined.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/i020.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Determining position (1)" /></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Example I.</span> (see diagram, Fig. 1).&mdash;Bring the
compass in its box on deck (it should be of large
size, so as to guide the eye; and small pocket-compasses
are useless for this purpose), and, standing
behind it, line with the eye with great care the bearing
of the north lighthouse by the compass, this
we will suppose to be N.W. by N.; mark this upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78">[78]</a></span>
a slip of paper, and then move the person so as
to see the south lighthouse in the same way across
the face of the compass,
which is always between
the observer and the object
to be observed; and
line the bearing of this
lighthouse by compass, in
the same manner, which
we will suppose to be
S.W. With these two
results marked upon paper,
refer to the chart, and place the parallel-rulers
upon the printed compass, designed upon the
chart, upon the line of N.W. by W. and S.E. by S.
(its opposite), and move them by means of the
pivots till one part of them rests upon north lighthouse;
then draw a line of indefinite length upon
the chart. Take up the rulers, and in the same
manner place them upon the printed compass on
the chart, on the line of S.W. and N.E., and carry
them forward, keeping
this angle, till some part
rests upon south lighthouse;
then draw a line
which will at some point
intersect the former line,
which, if the bearings have been correctly taken,
will be the exact position of the yacht at the time
of the observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be shown too, by experiment, that considerable
variation of the bearings, when the angle is
large, may be made, without changing very much
the position of the yacht, proving how valuable
this process is for practical use, as a considerable
error in the bearings will still enable one to know
almost exactly the position of the yacht; whilst a
good observation will give it exact.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 45%;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Determining position (2)" /></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Example II.</span> (see diagram Fig. 2).&mdash;Placing the
compass in front of the observer, it is found that the
lighthouse bears W. by compass, and that the lightship
bears S. W. by S. With these two bearings we
consult the chart, and lay off the two lines by means
of the parallel-rulers; and, if the chart gives the distance
in miles of the lightship from the lighthouse,
then, by means of a common rule of equal parts,
we shall be able to measure the distance of the
yacht from the lighthouse or from the lightship. At
the foot of most charts, however, will be found a
scale of miles, and, having once ascertained the
exact position of the yacht by means of cross-bearings,
it will be very easy, with a pair of dividers,
to find its distance in miles from any desired
object within view, or designed upon the chart,
and, by the use of the parallel-rulers, the course,
by compass, that should be sailed to reach any
desired point.</p>

<p>It is often useful to know how many geographical
or nautical miles, which measure at the equator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80">[80]</a></span>
6,086.4 feet in length, are contained in a degree of
longitude at different latitudes; that is to say, a
degree of longitude east or west of 89 N. latitude
is only 1.05 nautical mile in length; and yet, in
another sense, this 1.05 is 60 miles, or one degree
in length: hence the following table:&mdash;</p>

consequently the number of seconds elapsed

from A to B, the effect on the boat
will be the same as if she be at rest, and
the wind blow in the direction A C with
a velocity represented by A C, the velocity
of the yacht being represented by
B C. In this case, the angle B A C will
represent the difference between the true
and apparent direction of the wind, the
apparent being more ahead than the true; and,
the faster the vessel goes, the more ahead the wind
will appear to be. We must, however, except the
case where the wind is directly aft, in which case
the direction is not altered.</p>

<p>It is owing to the difference between the true
and apparent directions of the wind that it appears
to shift its direction by tacking ship; and if the
difference of the directions be observed when on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84">[84]</a></span>
different boards (the wind on both tacks being
supposed to remain constant, and the yacht to have
the same velocity, and to sail at the same distance
from the wind), the half-difference will be equal
to the angle B A C. By knowing this, together with
the velocity of the yacht B C, and the angle B C A,
we may obtain the true velocity of the wind; or by
knowing the velocity of the wind and of the yacht,
and the apparent direction of the wind, we may
calculate the difference between the true and apparent
directions of the wind.</p>

<p>Thus, if the velocity of a yacht, represented by
B C, be 7 miles per hour, that of the wind, represented
by A B, 27 miles per hour, and the angle
with the yacht's course, with the apparent direction
of the wind B C A, equal to 7-1/2 points, the difference
between the true and apparent directions of
the wind will be obtained by drawing the line B C,
equal to 7-1/2 points; then with an extent equal to
27 miles, taken from the scale, and with one foot in
B, describe an arc, to cut the line A C in A; join
A B; then the angle B A C, being measured, will be
the required difference between the true and apparent
directions of the wind.</p>

<p><i>Sailing in my yacht, I saw a lighthouse bearing E.
by N., and, after sailing 14 miles N. by W., it
bore S. E. Required the distance of the yacht
from the lighthouse at both stations.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Measuring distances" /></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Solution.</span>&mdash;Describe the compass E. S. W., and
let its centre X represent the place of the yacht at
the first station; draw the N. by W. line, X Y,
equal to 14 miles, and Y will represent the second
station.</p>

<p>Draw the line E. by N.,
X Z, of an indefinite
length, and the line Y Z
parallel to the S. E. and
N. W. line of the compass:
the point of intersection
Z will represent the place
of the lighthouse, and the
distance Y Z, being measured
by the same scale
of equal parts with which the 14 miles of course is
laid off, will be found to be 16-3/4 miles, and X Z 9-1/4
miles.</p>

<h4>USE OF THE CHARTS.</h4>

<p>Charts can be purchased, at a very reasonable
rate, of all the important harbors and the whole
coast-line of the United States. They come nicely
backed with cloth, so as to stand considerable hard
sea-usage. They should be kept, when not in use,
rolled up in a large tin box made for the purpose,
or a long, narrow wooden trunk, called a chart-box.</p>

<p>In using charts, <i>great care should be taken to see
whether or not the courses laid down to be sailed
are magnetic ones; that is, with the variation of the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86">[86]</a></span>
<i>compass allowed</i>. Such is usually the case; but
there are charts made where the variation of the
compass must be allowed to make the courses true.</p>

<p>Always carefully read all the notes upon the margins
of a chart: one will often run across an item
of the greatest interest or importance. Nearly all
charts of harbors and the coast-line will be found
with two scales of miles upon them; one being
marked <i>statute miles</i>, and the other <i>nautical miles</i>.</p>

<p>Now, the difference is this, the scale that is
marked statute miles means a mile of 320 rods of
16-1/2 feet each, or 1,760 yards of 3 feet each, or
5,280 feet; whilst a nautical mile means the sixtieth
part of a degree of the earth's surface measured
at the equator, which is about 6,086.4 feet in
length.</p>

<h4>SOUNDINGS</h4>

<p>Are very regular upon the American coast; and
if the time of tide be known, and the note concerning
soundings, on the margin of the chart, consulted,
one can often, when caught in a fog, tell
quite correctly the position of the yacht, its general
place upon the chart being known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lead-Line.</span>&mdash;For the purpose of getting
soundings, the lead-line must be used, of which
there are two kinds,&mdash;the <i>dipsey lead</i>, i.e., the deep-sea
lead, and the hand lead. The deep-sea lead
consists of a lead sinker, usually about twenty-five
pounds in weight, the lower part of which is hollowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87">[87]</a></span>
out, and filled with tallow, when it is said to
be <i>armed</i>: this is for the purpose of bringing up a
specimen of the bottom which it strikes upon in its
descent, often thus aiding the navigator in determining
his position. The line to which this lead
is attached is coiled up in a half-barrel or tub, and
is usually a hundred fathoms in length, a fathom
being six feet. It is generally as large as one's little
finger, and is laid up in what sailors call a "left-handed
coil," the opposite to most other ropes in
common use. It is marked up to twenty fathoms
in the same manner as the hand lead-line, and
then one knot for every ten fathoms, and a strip of
leather for each five fathoms. The manner of casting
the deep-sea lead is to bring the yacht to the
wind, and as nearly stationary as possible, when
the lead is taken by hand outside of all the rigging,
forward on the weather-side, the tub remaining aft;
the person forward then casts the lead as far as
possible ahead of the yacht, singing out at the
same moment, "Watch! Oh, watch!" and the
person aft at the tub allows the line to be taken
out by the lead in its descent as fast as possible;
and when it reaches the bottom he hauls it carefully
up till his hand hits upon the knots, the number
of which determines the depth; the yacht is
then kept on her course, and the line hauled in
over the stern, and coiled down in the tub, as it
comes in, for immediate use again. When the lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88">[88]</a></span>
arrives on deck, it is unbent from the lead-line, the
arming examined and scraped off, ready for a new
cast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heaving the Hand Lead.</span>&mdash;The hand lead is
used in a different manner, and is the most perfect
instrument yet devised to warn the yachtsman or
sailor of unknown dangers and the rapid shoaling
of the water, or approach to some unknown or
unexpected shoal.</p>

<p>Custom has, from time immemorial, marked the
lead-line in a peculiar and, the writer does not hesitate
to say, ridiculous manner, which can be understood
by the initiated only. But that it may be
done according to "Gunter," and in "ship-shape
and Bristol fashion," the following explanation is
given:&mdash;</p>

<p>Heaving the lead is done usually by a person
who is placed in the main-chains for that purpose,
on the weather-side, or, in smaller craft, on deck,
forward, just clear of the shrouds. It is thrown
whilst the yacht is under way, and being kept on her
course, and the results announced in a singing voice
by the one casting; and, when the water becomes
too shoal, the yacht is put about, and stands off
from the danger which she was approaching. The
one casting the lead takes hold of the line at about
a fathom from it, and swings it to and fro till
enough velocity is gained to swing it over his head;
when at the right angle it is released, and flies forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89">[89]</a></span>
in the air, striking the water far in advance of
the yacht and the bottom, before the yacht reaches
the place where it struck the water, so that the line
may be kept perpendicular for a moment from the
yacht to the bottom of the sea, and the distance
measured by means of marks upon the lead-line,
which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="width:2em;">At&nbsp;</span>1 fathom      one knot.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  two knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">3&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  three knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">5&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a white rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">6&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">7&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  a red rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">8&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">9&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">10&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  leather with one hole.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">11&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  one knot.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">12&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  two knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">13&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">14&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">15&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  white rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">16&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">17&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  red rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">18&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">19&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">20&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  leather with two holes.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Those that are marked are called "marks," the
others, "deeps;" and a lead-line as above consists
of eleven "marks" and nine "deeps."</p>

<p>If the mark of three fathoms is near the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90">[90]</a></span>
of the water, the caster sings out, "By the mark
three!" or, if such be the case, "By the deep
eight!" and, should he consider the depth to be a
quarter or half more than any particular number,
he sings out, "And a quarter six!" or, "A half
five!" &amp;c. If the depth is estimated to be three-quarters
more than any particular number, he calls
it a quarter less than the next higher number;
thus, at two fathoms and three-quarters, he sings
out, "A quarter less three!"</p>

<p>For all practical purposes a lead-line twenty
fathoms in length, but marked only to ten fathoms,
will be the most useful for yachts and small sail-boats.
This line should be marked as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="width:2em;">At&nbsp;</span>1 fathom      one knot.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  two knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">3&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  three knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">4&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  four knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">5&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  white rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">6&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  six knots.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">7&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  red rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">8&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  blue rag.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">9&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nothing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">10&nbsp;  "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  piece of leather.</span><br />
</p>

<p>A small piece of white rag may also be inserted at
the half-fathoms between two and three.</p>

<h4>EIGHT BELLS, AND WATCH AND WATCH.</h4>

<p>Time at sea is divided differently than on shore;
and the day commences at twelve o'clock, noon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91">[91]</a></span>
The reason of this is, that at that time usually, at
sea, the navigator determines and ascertains the
position of the ship, hence the true time; and the
clock is corrected from the difference in longitude
from noon of the preceding day.</p>

<p>The time of twelve o'clock is denoted by striking
the vessel's bell eight times in a peculiar manner,
thus: by sets of twos, one, two, rapidly following
each other, then a pause of three or four
seconds, and then the next set of twos, thus: one,
two&mdash;one, two&mdash;one, two&mdash;one, two; whilst
seven bells would be struck thus: one, two&mdash;one,
two&mdash;one, two&mdash;one; and three bells: one, two&mdash;one;
four bells: one, two&mdash;one, two.</p>

<p>This system of eight strokes of the bell does for
the whole twenty-four hours, each stroke denoting
one half-hour: hence eight bells cover a space of
four hours, which is termed a watch, and, if each
watch was four hours long, of course there would
be six such watches in the twenty four hours; and
the crew, divided as they always are into starboard
and port watches, would, during the whole voyage,
have just the same hours on deck. That is to say,
the starboard watch would come on deck at twelve
o'clock noon every day of the voyage, and stay till
four <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>This would not be fair to the other watch; and to
avoid this repetition, and to divide the time differently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92">[92]</a></span>
each day, the hours from four to eight in the
afternoon are divided up into what are called <i>dog-watches</i>
of two hours each, which breaks up the
daily regularity, and changes the hours; so that the
starboard watch who happen to be on deck from
twelve to four <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> one day are the next day below
during the same hours, and the port watch on
deck; and thus the same watches come round every
forty-eight hours. After the bell is struck at twelve
noon by order of the navigator or sailing-master,
the time will be kept as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In cases of emergency, usually to take in sail,

<h4>BOXING THE COMPASS</h4>

<p>Is the term used for repeating the thirty-two points
of the compass-card by memory from the right
hand to the left, (and then back again,) commencing
at north, and proceeding to north by east, north,
north-east, &amp;c. It is necessary that the amateur
and young salt should acquire this, if he desires to
ever be able to make use of the most simple problems
in boat-sailing, the use of the charts, the finding
of the position of the yacht by cross-bearings,
&amp;c. In fact, it is indispensable; and the task should
be commenced at once. It should not be gotten
by rote, without rhyme or reason; but, in repeating
the names of the points, <i>the compass-card, or a
printed imitation of it, should always be kept before
the eye</i> [see frontispiece].</p>

<p>After acquiring the regular thirty-two points, the
subdivision of quarter and half points are to be gone
into. The smallest division used in navigation is a
quarter of a point; thus your course may be N. by
E. 1/4 E., or N. by E. 1/2 E., or N. by E. 3/4 E.; but
no smaller subdivision is ever made between two
courses than one-quarter of a point. This is as near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95">[95]</a></span>as the yacht can be kept to her course, and is as
near as the eye can line a course in an observation
for cross-bearings. If, however, one desires more
minuteness, it may be well to state that each point
of the compass contains 11 15', or 360 for the
whole thirty-two points. The names of the points
of the compass, commencing at north, and going
towards east, are as follows. The <i>principal points</i>,
as they are called, which are marked larger than the
others on the compass-card, are here designated by
capitals.</p>

<p>If any one desires to be <i>very salt</i>, he will pronounce

</table>

<p>And, in fact, the above is the way that they are
pronounced by all sailors.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the <i>compass does
not move</i>; that is to say, the yacht moves, which
seemingly makes the card in the compass-box revolve.
It is absolutely an optical illusion to "land-lubbers"
and except by the jar of the yacht,
or by pitching about in a heavy sea, the compass-card
does not revolve, but is stationary, and it is
the change of the course of the yacht which seems
to give it motion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h4>TO PLACE A COMPASS TO STEER BY.</h4>

<p>The periphery of the circular casing in which
the card revolves should be marked plainly with
a perpendicular black line; and this black line
should, by moving the compass-box, be brought to
bear in a direct line with the keel of the yacht, and
the box secured in that position. One has then
only to move the helm to bring each and every
point on the compass-card opposite to this black
mark on the compass-box, and, having once brought
the point needed to this position, keep it there by
moving the helm when necessary; and this act of
keeping it there is called "keeping the vessel on
her course."</p>

<p>For instance: if the wind allows, suppose by the
chart it is desired to steer N.E., to reach a certain
place. Go on deck, and, by moving the helm,
bring the N.E. point of the compass-card opposite
to the black perpendicular mark on the compass-casing,
and keep on your way, after having
trimmed your sails so as to hold the wind properly.
The yacht will not keep on N.E. exactly, but will
yaw to and fro, <i>which will seem as if the compass-card
was moving</i>; and this will occur more or less
according to the roughness of the water. And, if
one looks too much to the compass, the yacht will
be off the course before the compass shows it:
it is therefore well, if possible, to get some bearing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98">[98]</a></span>
miles ahead, that cuts the weather-shrouds or jib-stay,
when the yacht is on her course; then, by looking
at that, one can easily see when she is off her
course, casting an eye to the compass once in a
while. In the night-time very fine steering can be
done by picking out a star, and steering by it, after
getting it to range on some part of the yacht. Steering
by a compass is a great accomplishment: few
amateurs do it well. It used to be said at sea, that
the best helmsmen <i>looked at the head of the vessel</i>
oftener than the compass, and were thus enabled to
check with the helm any disposition of the vessel
to leave the true course, long before the departure
was shown by the compass-card.</p>

<h4>VELOCITY OF WIND.</h4>

<p>Generally speaking, a wind that blows sixteen
miles an hour is called a fresh breeze. One that
blows eighteen miles an hour calls for a single reef;
and twenty miles, a close reef. Twenty-four miles
an hour is a gale; whilst thirty miles an hour is a
fresh gale.</p>

<h4>THE LOG, REEL, AND HALF-MINUTE GLASS.</h4>

<p>This method of ascertaining how fast the yacht
is moving through the water, and hence to calculate
her position, has been almost done away with by
the use of what is termed the "patent log," which is
now almost universally used, and which consists of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99">[99]</a></span>
a small propeller of brass, which is towed astern,
and records its own revolutions on dials. But, to
enable one to use the common log-line and glass,
the following description is written: The half-minute
glass is of the same form as an hour-glass,
and contains such a quantity of sand as will run
through its neck in twenty-eight seconds of time;
or a watch with a second-hand may be used, if the
glass is not handy. The <i>log</i> is a piece of thin
board of a quadrantal form, about the size and
shape of a quarter-section of the bottom of a common
water-pail, loaded on the circular side with
enough lead to make it swim upright in the water.
To this is fastened a line, about one hundred and
fifty fathoms in length, called the <i>log-line</i>, which is
divided into intervals called <i>knots</i>, and is wound on
a reel which turns very easily.</p>

<p>To ascertain the velocity at which the yacht is
sailing is called <i>heaving the log</i>, and is performed
as follows: one person holds the reel, and another
the half-minute glass, whilst a third throws the log
over the stern on the lee-side; and, when he observes
that the stray line has run off (which is
about ten fathoms), and the first mark (which is
generally a red rag) has passed the stern, he sings
out, <i>Turn</i>: the glass-holder answers, <i>Turn</i>, and,
watching the glass, the moment it has run out, sings
out, <i>Stop</i>. The reel being immediately stopped, the
last mark run off shows the number of knots that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">[100]</a></span>
the yacht has sailed during the last hour, if the
wind has been constant.</p>

<p>The log-line is marked as follows: allow ten
fathoms for stray line, and then insert a red rag, and
at every 47.6 feet mark the line as follows: at one,
one leather; at two, two knots; at three, three
knots; and also have a small mark at each half-knot,
and so on to ten and twelve knots.</p>

<p>The principle of the log-line is, that a knot is
the same part of a sea-mile that half a minute is of
an hour: therefore the length of a knot should be
one hundred and twentieth the length of a sea-mile,
or fifty-one feet; but, as it is more convenient
to have the knot divided into eight parts of six feet
each, the proportional reduction is necessary in the
half-minute glass.</p>

<h4>BUOYS.</h4>

<p>In entering harbors, the <i>red buoys</i> are to be left
upon the starboard hand, and the <i>black</i> buoys upon
the port hand.</p>

<h4>MAN OVERBOARD.</h4>

<p>Throw overboard at once any light object that
will float, such as a stool, oar, boat-hook, or life-preserver,
for him to grasp; then bring the yacht
at once to the wind and heave her to, and pick up
the man with the tender, or by going about and
standing for him. <i>Don't look out astern for the
man where he disappeared</i>, but out on the beam,
which will be his position when the yacht is brought
to the wind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h4>PRACTICAL HINTS ON BOAT-SAILING.</h4>

<p>Remember, in the first place, that no small boat
fit to be called a sail-boat can capsize, unless the
sail is confined by the sheet being made fast.</p>

<p>If the sail is loose, and the boom, or lower leach
of the sail, as the case may be, can move in a
direction parallel to the wind, or in the "wind's
eye" as sailors would say, the boat cannot be upset
by an ordinary gust of wind.</p>

<p>In other words, in all fore-and-aft sails, such as
are used almost the world over for small sail-boats,
the sheet, or rope that confines the after-part of the
sail to the stern-part of the boat, is the key to the
whole science of boat-sailing.</p>

<p>If one knows how to use the sheet properly,
one knows how to sail a boat with comparative
safety. Of course it is supposed that he should
also understand flaws of wind and their effects.</p>

<p>It is the flaws of wind caught by the sail&mdash;more
than it can bear&mdash;that capsize a boat; and, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102">[102]</a></span>
wind that has force enough to do this could be
"spilled" out of the sail, the boat would be immediately
relieved.</p>

<p>Therefore to insure safety, the person steering a
boat should never belay the sheet, but keep it in
hand, so as to be able to slack it off gradually, or
cast it off entirely at a moment's notice. To do
this, only one turn should be taken round the cleat;
so that the sheet will slip under the force of a gust
of wind, when the hand retaining it in place slackens
it in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>If the whole sail points towards the wind's eye,
it no longer has any effect upon the boat. The
sail then shakes in the wind exactly as a flag does
from the top of a flag-staff, the wind passing by on
both sides. Should the sheet be hauled aft, the
sail would be filled with wind upon one side, and, if
the wind had strength to overcome the gravity of
the boat, capsize her.</p>

<p>Or, if the boat is so heavy ballasted that its gravity
cannot be readily overcome, the mast or sail are
liable to be carried away, and danger incurred on
account of the towing mast and sail. These would
most likely draw the boat into the trough of the
sea, where she would be swamped almost instantly.</p>

<p>It does not follow, because the slacking of the
sheet is a safe thing to do, that it should always be
done. With boatmen who are thoroughly practised,
it seldom is done; for they can obtain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103">[103]</a></span>
same result with the rudder by bringing the boat
into the wind until the sail shakes, with the sheet
still fast. This gives more control of the boat than
would be the case if the boom were out to leeward,
perhaps dragging in the water, on account of the
pressure of the wind upon the hull and mast.</p>

<p>The very best thing to do in a sudden squall is to
use a modification of both these methods; i.e., slack
off the sheet for a foot or two, so that the sail, before
it can fill with wind, will be at such an angle with
the hull, that the shock upon the latter cannot be
great. This gives one more command of the boat,
and insures quicker movement of the hull, and
hence quicker obedience to the helm, should a
sudden change occur. This slacking of the sheet
also prevents the boat from going about on the
other tack, should she be brought too suddenly to
the wind.</p>

<p>With an experienced hand at the helm, unless
the squall is very severe, there is no need of luffing
so as to shake the sail to any great degree. The
slightest movement of the tiller will keep the sail
just quivering in the wind, the boat still advancing,
so that she will not lose steerage-way; thus enabling
one to at once luff up nearer to the wind, or
change the boat's position rapidly, should the wind,
which is often the case, shift its direction suddenly.</p>

<p>Nothing is of more importance than to keep
steerage-way on the boat, as it is only in the utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104">[104]</a></span>
emergency that the sheet should be slacked
wholly off, and the headway lost.</p>

<p>If the boat is well under command when the
squall is seen advancing, then the method of steering
into the wind's eye may be safely adopted,
and is, in fact, the better and more seamanlike
method.</p>

<p>In small sail-boats on ponds, or arms of the sea,
when a thunder-shower is coming up,&mdash;which can
always be seen in time,&mdash;it is, as a rule, much the
safest plan to take the boat as quickly as possible
towards the nearest harbor or land, unless rocky,
inaccessible, or dangerous; in which case, furl all
sail and let go an anchor, paying out such a scope
of cable that the boat will ride easily. Then wait
for the coming blast.</p>

<p>However severe it may be, the thunder-gust can
then do no harm. With an oar you can head the
boat towards the coming blast, so that she will feel
but little of its force, and prevent the dragging of
the anchor.</p>

<p>Thunder-showers are particularly dangerous, however,
from the fact that they almost always make
their way directly against the prevailing wind.
When the two winds meet, and one finds one's self
in the vortex between them, it is very difficult to
command a boat. Each wind, fighting for the
supremacy, will fill the sails with gusts, for which
one does not more than have time to prepare before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105">[105]</a></span>
a counter-gust will throw them aback, or violently
to the opposite side of the boat. Often, in fact,
the wind, blowing a gale all the time, will in less
than five minutes have visited every point of the
compass. An anchor down and a furled sail are the
best for all small, open, or half-decked boats or
yachts in such an emergency.</p>

<p>Boats are often capsized by persons on board
suddenly scrambling to the windward, or upper
side, when a squall buries the lee gunwale in the
water. Should the boat at this moment be taken
aback by a counter squall or flaw, she will almost
surely capsize, for in one moment the windward
side becomes the leeward side; and the mass of
weight hanging to what was, a moment before, the
weather-side, will carry the boat over. It is too
late to try and struggle back again: the bodies are
all in the wrong position to be able to turn around
inboard towards the centre of the boat. In their
helpless postures they face the waves that are ready
to devour them.</p>

<p>The safest position in an open boat, when preparing
for an approaching squall, is, for all except
the helmsman, to sit down in the bottom of the
boat, as near the centre as possible, thus being safe
from any blows from the boom of the sail, and increasing
the steadiness of the boat in a marked
degree. Here they act as ballast, and do much
good in keeping the boat upright.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106">[106]</a></span>To the above knowledge should be added also
the science of reefing the sails of a boat quickly
and neatly, so that she will stand up under a great
pressure of wind.</p>

<p>The mistake most frequently made is to neglect
to reef till it is too late. Landsmen scarcely ever
calculate how quickly wind moves, and how suddenly
a change in the weather takes place. It is
easy to reef while there is time, but sometimes
almost impossible if too long delayed. Reefing
saves one from much anxiety. The boat that with
her whole sail would be cranky and dangerous
plunges along buoyantly through the summer gale
when her sails are properly reefed.</p>

<p>With a thorough knowledge of the sheet and
rudder, and how to reef a sail, there ought to be
no accidents, even in very small boats; but the
trouble is, that too many tyros are allowed to invite
unsuspecting ladies and young girls into their boats,
they not understanding the first rudiments of a real
nautical knowledge, of how to manage a craft in
times of danger.</p>

<p>A boat is like a good horse,&mdash;it will always do
the best it can. It will not capsize if it can help
it; but, if mismanaged in time of emergency, it is
a dangerous plaything. Properly handled, it is
amazing, almost incredible, what can be done with
a small open boat, with a common lug-sail, and
what weather it will live through.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107">[107]</a></span>But without knowledge, and knowing just what
to do in dangerous times, this pleasant summer sail
is a treacherous pastime.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h4>A SHORT CRUISE WITH A SLOOP-YACHT, ILLUSTRATING
THE COMMON SEA-MAN&OElig;UVRES.</h4>

<p>"Well, uncle Charley, when are you going to
give me a sail in your yacht? You know, that,
although I have sailed a little, I look forward with
the greatest impatience to a trip with you; so that
I may become posted in all respects, and finally
turn out a first-class sailor."</p>

<p>"Your ambition is a worthy one, Tom; and I am
willing to gratify it. But it is yet very early in the
season; and I am afraid that we shall encounter
some dirty weather, should we attempt now to make
a trip."</p>

<p>"Well, that is the very thing that I want to
encounter," said Tom. "Besides, you have quite
a large yacht, and every thing in apple-pie order;
whilst I only have a little bit of an open boat at my
home, and really know but little of the science of
boat-sailing, and nothing of the technical language
or discipline of a well-appointed vessel."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109">[109]</a></span>Thus spoke Tom Coffin, a young man of some
seventeen years, who was on a visit to his uncle,
Capt. Charles Coffin, a middle-aged retired sea-captain,
who knew a vessel from her stem to her
stern, and who retained his youthful passion for the
water, and enjoyed himself thoroughly during the
summer months in his beautiful yacht "Nancy
Lee."</p>

<p>"By the way, uncle Charley, you have not told
me any thing yet about your yacht; and you know
I have never seen her. How large is she?"</p>

<p>"She is about thirty feet over all," said his uncle.</p>

<p>"How is she rigged? Tell me all about her,
uncle, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, the 'Nancy Lee' was built two years ago,
and is what is called a 'centre-board sloop;' that
is, she is shallow, and broad of beam, and is rigged
as a sloop. She has a good comfortable cabin, and
sound spars, and strong and durable canvas, and
good ground-tackle, and I think she will compare
favorably with any of her class. She is not so fast
as some, being, as I said, of good beam, and her
spars and sails are not too large for rough weather;
but I consider her a first-class boat for outside
work, safe, strong, and easily managed."</p>

<p>"How many crew do you carry, uncle Charley?"</p>

<p>"Well, as a general rule, I have only Bob Stevens
with me, who made, if you remember, many voyages
to sea with me, and is a true, able seaman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110">[110]</a></span>
in every sense of the word. He usually keeps the
'Nancy' in order for me, and acts as 'cook and all
hands;' although, when I am going on a cruise of
a week or two, I usually take with me also Widow
Tompkins's son, who is smart and active, and who,
if he will only take a voyage round the Horn, will,
I prophesy, yet turn out a good sailor. But you
shall take his place."</p>

<p>"Is the yacht all ready now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied uncle Charley. "She has
been at her moorings the last two weeks. But I
thought I would give you a day or two to get over
your journey before speaking about a cruise; but I
see that young blood will not be restrained."</p>

<p>"And have you every thing on board ready for a
cruise?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, every thing," replied his uncle; "for,
being an old sailor, I like to have every thing prepared.
Now, on board the 'Nancy Lee' you will
find, I will be bound, every thing that is needful for
a craft of her size; such as compass, charts, signal-lights,
barometer, lead-line, log, and all that is needful
to handle her in a seamanlike manner in all
weathers."</p>

<p>"Well, uncle, when will you start? Have you
provisions on board?"</p>

<p>"Every thing is on board; and, as you have inoculated
me, I suppose we might as well get under
way to-morrow morning on the young ebb: so take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111">[111]</a></span>
yourself up aloft, young man, and 'turn in,' and be
prepared to turn out at about one bell in the morning
watch; and I will go down to the landing, and
see that Bob has every thing in ship-shape."</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>"Come, rouse out, youngster! it is past one
bell," sang out the cheery voice of uncle Charley
at Tom's door the next morning; and hurrying on
his clothes, and taking a small valise filled with a
change or two fit for sea-use, he was soon by his
uncle's side.</p>

<p>"Well, it is going to be a lovely morning, if it is
only the 10th of May," said Capt. Coffin.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you know, uncle Charley? It is
as dark as pitch yet."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, when you are as old as I am,
you will know how, by many signs, to forecast the
weather, even in the night-time. But let us hurry
along, and get on board, as I want to take advantage
of this ebb to get outside before the flood makes."</p>

<p>Arriving at the landing, the following conversation
took place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Nancy,' ahoy!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain."</p>

<p>"Come ashore in the tender, and set us on
board!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112">[112]</a></span>The small boat soon reached the landing; and
our friends were soon alongside the "Nancy Lee,"
and quickly on board.</p>

<p>"Now, Bob," said Capt. Coffin, "have you got
hot coffee and biscuit ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain, all ready, and humming hot on the
stove."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we will go below, Bob, and you can
serve it in the cabin; for it is well to get something
hot down before facing this damp morning air."</p>

<p>After each had drunk a good hot mug of strong
coffee without milk, and eaten a good large sea-biscuit,
Capt. Coffin and Tom appeared again on
deck, and preparations were made to get under
way.</p>

<p>"Have you got the stops off of the mainsail,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain: they are all off."</p>

<p>"Then go forward, you two," said Capt. Coffin,
"and hoist away the mainsail. You take the peak-halliards,
Tom; and you the throat, Bob. That's
the way! Up she goes! [Cheerily.] Avast,
there, Tom! you are hoisting too fast on the peak,
and have jammed the hoops round the mast, so that
Bob can't get an inch on the throat-halliards. Slack
away a little! Handsomely: there, that will do!
Now hoist away. Belay the peak-halliards! Now
go over and take in the slack, whilst Bob swigs
off on the throat-halliards: that will do. Belay!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113">[113]</a></span>
Now over to the peak, and stand by to peak it up,
whilst I let go the main-sheet, and lift up the main-boom.
So! That will do. Belay! Now coil the
halliards down snug, and lay aft here, Tom, and
tend the jib-sheet.&mdash;Are the gaskets off the jib,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir! All off!"</p>

<p>"Then let go your down-haul, and run her up!</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, I want to cast to starboard; and, as
the yacht is now lying head to wind, when Bob has
the jib up, I want you to trim down flat on the port
jib-sheet, and hold on till I tell you to let go.&mdash;Now,
Bob, is that jib chock up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain."</p>

<p>"All right, then; slip your moorings, and let her
slide! Haul aft the port jib-sheet, Tom; and lay
aft here, Bob, and help shove this boom out to starboard,
whilst I put the helm to port. There, she
pays off all right! Down with the centre-board,
Bob!&mdash;Let go the jib-sheet, and trim down to starboard,
Tom! That will do. Belay!</p>

<p>"There! Don't she move through the water
well? Just a nice working-breeze. And see the
glimmer of the breaking day over there to the eastward!
I wonder if we can fetch by Rouse's Point
without going about. I fear not; but we shall see
long before we get there. There is plenty of time.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, do you see that little light on shore,
just forward of the weather fore-rigging? Come
and stand just where I am, and see if you see it."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114">[114]</a></span>"Yes, uncle, I see it all right."</p>

<p>"Well, take the helm, and keep her just as she
goes, with that light cutting the weather-rigging, as
a course. She steers like a pilot-boat, and you will
have no trouble.&mdash;Bob, keep a good lookout there
forward, whilst I go below to have a look at the
chart."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, I have looked carefully at the chart,
and I know this harbor well; but the wind is so
scant, that I am afraid that we shall not be able to
lie by Rouse's Point without going about; and I had
rather do it now than when we get farther down,
and nearer to the point, for there are some bad
rocks make off: so I think that we will go about
to make all sure.</p>

<p>"Ready about!</p>

<p>"Come aft, Bob, and tend the lee jib-sheet!&mdash;And
you look out for the weather one, Tom! All ready!
Hard a-lee! Let go the jib-sheet! Avast hauling,
Tom: you are too quick!&mdash;Trim down, Bob!&mdash;Now
let draw, and trim down flat, Tom, and
belay! There, she begins to trot again! We can't
stand very far in this direction; for we are crossing
the channel at about right angles, and it is not more
than a mile and a half wide hereabouts; and I
don't want to be picked up by any of these flats on
an ebb tide, and don't mean to; and yet I want to
stand over just as far as I can, so as to clear Rouse's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115">[115]</a></span>
Point on the next tack. There comes the daylight
at last! Is it not a beautiful sight, Tom?&mdash;Come,
Bob, jump below, and get up the hand lead, and
give us a few casts from the weather-rigging.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Then cast."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span>&mdash;And a quarter less five.</p>

<p>"That is plenty of water; isn't it, Tom? But then
you can't be too careful, and there is nothing like
the lead. We only draw eight feet and a half with
the centre-board down, and only three and a half
with it up: so we have little to fear yet. Keep casting,
Bob!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span>&mdash;By the deep, four!</p>

<p>"There, you see Tom, we have already commenced
to shoal our water."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span>&mdash;And a quarter less three!</p>

<p>"Still shoaling, and pretty fast too."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span>&mdash;And by the mark, two!</p>

<p>"We are getting well over, Tom; but we will
have a cast or two more from Bob."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span>&mdash;And a quarter less two!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span>&mdash;And a half one!</p>

<p>"Ready about!</p>

<p>"Hard a-lee!</p>

<p>"There, Tom, you did better with your jib-sheet
that time, and did not try to haul it over too quick,
and before Bob had trimmed it down again to make
her pay off.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116">[116]</a></span>"See, Tom, the day is breaking fast, and there is
Rouse's Point well on our lee. If the wind holds,
we shall not have the slightest difficulty in passing
it on this tack. And now, as we are going to make
a long leg, we will let Bob go below and get breakfast
ready. Do you think you can eat any thing,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, I think I can; but this is just splendid.
But tell, me, why do you trim down the jib
again on the same side, after letting it go? Would
not the yacht come about without it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she would," replied Capt. Coffin, "easily;
but I wanted you to see how a craft should be put
about in a seamanlike manner, and how she would
have to be put about in heavy weather. It is well
to know how to do a thing well, and what will be
necessary in times of emergency."</p>

<p>"Thank you, uncle: I shall remember. Is it not
a lovely morning, and how nicely we are slipping
along! I think I could eat a piece of whale's
blubber, I am so hungry."</p>

<p>"Are you, Tom? Well, so am I. But here
comes Bob up the companion-way, to say that
breakfast is ready.</p>

<p>"Now, Bob, keep her full and by; and, if she
breaks off any, call me at once, for we shall have to
go about again.</p>

<p>"Let's get below, Tom, and get our breakfast;
for I must not be long below till we get well outside.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117">[117]</a></span>"Is this not a snug little cabin? and haven't I
got things handy around me? I like to have things
where I can put my hand upon them quickly.</p>

<p>"If you have finished, we will go on deck again.</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, has she held her course?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe she has changed it a pint,
Capt. Coffin."</p>

<p>"Well, go below and get your breakfast, and
clear things up. We will look out for her. In an
hour or two we shall be out in the sound all clear."</p>

<p>"See, uncle, how we have gained upon that fishing-schooner!
Are we not going to pass too near
him? He evidently is beating out as well as we."</p>

<p>"You are right, Tom. If we should keep on,
there would be a collision; but as we are on the
port tack, and the fishing-schooner on the starboard tack,
and both of us close-hauled, he has the right
of way; and it is therefore for that reason that I
gracefully ease off the main-sheet, as you see, and
keep her off, so as to pass under his stern, whilst he
passes saucily on his course and to windward. But
it is his right, and we must not hesitate. When we
are on the starboard tack, we will demand our rights
just as strongly."</p>

<p>"I am afraid after all, uncle Charley, that it is
going to be rough; is it not? The day is not as
pleasant as it was an hour ago, and it seems kind
of overcast and cloudy to windward."</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom: the weather does look a little dirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118">[118]</a></span>
to windward, but nothing to speak of; but, as you
started to see some fun, I hope that you will see it."</p>

<p>"How far do you call us now from the land?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say that we were a good ten
miles from the southern light. I can tell you
exactly by cross-bearings, if you really want to
know very much."</p>

<p>"No, uncle, I do not care enough to give you
that trouble; and, besides, I only wanted to know
about how far off you estimated it. We must be
going through the water pretty fast, as she is well
heeled over."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is jumping along now, and the wind
and sea are both getting up fast. I think that I
shall take in a reef.</p>

<p>"Never be ashamed, Tom, of reefing early: it is
a simple matter if undertaken in time; but, if neglected
too long, is a difficult, and at times a dangerous
job.</p>

<p>"In the first place, you and Bob get hold of that
tender, and draw her up on the lee-side, and get
her aboard forward, where she belongs, and lash
her down. Don't get overboard!</p>

<p>"Be careful of the rail, Bob: don't chafe it.
Now lash her down snug, and, as soon as you are
ready, man the jib-halliards and down-haul. All
ready?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Then let go the jib-halliards. Down with it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119">[119]</a></span>
Bob!&mdash;Lend a hand on the down-haul, Tom!
There, that will do! Make fast!</p>

<p>"Stand by the throat and peak-halliards! lower
away! That will do. Well of all. Belay! Come,
lay aft here, and bowse out on this reef-pennant!
That will do! Lay out on the boom, Bob, and pass
this earing! All fast?"</p>

<p>"All fast, sir."</p>

<p>"Then come in and get another earing for the
luff, Bob, and hurry up!</p>

<p>"That's the talk; make fast! Now tackle the
reef-points, and knot as fast as you can. Now lay
forward, and off with the bonnet, off the jib! And
sing out when you are ready.</p>

<p>"Now lay aft, and hoist up the mainsail! That
will do. Belay! Now up with the jib!</p>

<p>"There, off we go upon our course again. Do you
see how much better she stands up to it, Tom? and
how much better weather we are making? I don't
like the looks of things to windward, however; and
I guess that we will square away for a harbor that
I know on the other side of the sound, unless you
would like to heave to out here, and ride it out.
But we should make nothing by that, and we may
as well get in smoother water as to jump about
here; for it is coming on to blow fresh, if I know
any thing about weather. My barometer is falling
too, which is also a warning sign.</p>

<p>"Here comes an extra puff, rather more than we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120">[120]</a></span>
can stand even with this reef in; but you see, by
shaking her up into the wind, I have allowed all its
force to pass us without damage.</p>

<p>"Well, I think that we have had enough of this:
it is cold, and the water that we are taking on
board will soon chill us more. Here goes for
squaring away before it!</p>

<p>"Stand by the main-sheet and jib-halliards!</p>

<p>"Ease away on the main-sheet, Tom! handsomely!
Keep a good turn! Don't let it get
away with you. That will do!&mdash;Ease off the jib-sheet,
Bob! Make fast!"</p>

<p>"All fast, sir!"</p>

<p>"Why, uncle Charley, what a change! I should
think there was scarcely any wind at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a most common impression when
a craft is kept off before the wind after pounding
into it; but you should not be deceived. Now is
the time that you must pay great attention to the
helm; for the waves lift the stern so far out of the
water, that the rudder acts, as you see, in an irregular
and unequal manner, causing me to meet her
as she yaws with a quick movement of the helm.
I don't like the looks of the weather at all.</p>

<p>"Look out! Hold on, everybody! There,
that sea has pooped us, and we are all afloat! This
will never do.</p>

<p>"Stand by to haul aft the main-sheet! We
must shake out this reef, Bob, if it is blowing fresh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121">[121]</a></span>
so as to go faster before the wind, and not get
pooped again."</p>

<p>[The reef is shaken out, and the yacht again
kept away.]</p>

<p>"There, Tom! see how she runs away from
those large seas, now! No more danger of their
coming on board again.</p>

<p>"You see, the tide was against us, and the wind
astern; and the 'Nancy' moved too slowly forward
to escape those big fellows. This is one of the
times that it is good seamanship to clap on more
sail, although the sea is getting up. If we should
haul on a wind now, we should need two reefs in;
but, running before it, she is doing very well.</p>

<p>"There is the headland that we shall have to
leave on the port side. Do you see it, Tom? We
shall have to jibe before we can run in, and that is
a man&oelig;uvre that must be nicely executed in such a
sea-way as this. But we shall execute it all right,
as you shall see.</p>

<p>"Lay aft here, Bob, and stand by the peak-halliards!
Let go! That will do. Belay! Now
clap on this main-sheet, and get it aft, steadily.
Round it in!</p>

<p>"Keep a good turn at the cleat! Don't let the
boom get away with you! Now slack the lee jib-sheet
off, so that the jib can work itself. Now
look out for the jerk when the boom goes over,
and stand by to slack the sheet at once. Handsomely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122">[122]</a></span>
done! Slack away the main-sheet! Belay!
There, that is a good job! Up with the
peak! Belay!</p>

<p>"Go forward, Bob, and stock the second anchor;
and bend on the cable, and have it all ready for
anchoring; for we shall not find very much lee in
this harbor till the wind shifts. But there is good
holding-ground, and we shall be all right.</p>

<p>"As soon as we pass that lighthouse, Tom, and
get in the bight of the bay you see ahead on the
starboard side, I shall round her to, and let go the
anchors. There are two fishermen at anchor there
now. Do you see them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle, I see them; and they seem to be
laboring pretty heavy."</p>

<p>"Yes. That is because they are loaded deep;
but we shall ride like a bird.</p>

<p>"Haul down the jib, and stow it! Lend Bob a
hand, Tom. Now come aft here!</p>

<p>"Stand by the anchor, Bob!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Now you see, Tom, how I round her up under
the stern of this fisherman, and bring her head to
wind.</p>

<p>"Let go the anchor!"</p>

<p>"All gone."</p>

<p>"Don't check her too quick, Bob! Pay out!
pay out! Now snub her, but not too sharp. Does
she hold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She has brought up."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123">[123]</a></span>"Then let go the second anchor, and pay out
on both. Give your cables plenty of scope.
That will do. Make every thing fast.</p>

<p>"I can see by the land that she does not drag.
But jump below, Bob, and hand me up the hand
lead, that I may throw it over the side, and see
that she is holding all right.</p>

<p>"There, Tom! don't she ride easily?</p>

<p>"Now down mainsail, and stow it, before it is
slatted to pieces by the wind, and lash the helm
amidships. We shall ride here like a Mother
Carey's chicken.</p>

<p>"Now let's sound the pumps, and then we will
go below, and take things easy till this wind moderates;
have a good, nice dinner; and then we
will proceed upon our cruise. Well, Tom, do you
think you have smelt salt water, boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle; but I like it, though, and the way
you manage, in spite of the elements. We have
not started a rope-yarn, and are lying here as snug
as a bug in a rug."</p>

<p>And thus we will leave them, wishing them good
weather, and a pleasant ending to their cruise.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
